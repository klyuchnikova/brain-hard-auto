Add the seeds and the pod to the cream and milk mixture.\n\n2. **Heat the Cream and Milk:** In a saucepan, heat the cream, milk, and vanilla bean (and pod if using) over medium heat until just before it comes to a boil. Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes.\n\n3. **Combine Egg Yolks and Sugar:** In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of sugar until the mixture is pale and thick.\n\n4. **Temper the Egg Mixture:** Slowly pour the warm cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture while whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from cooking instantly.\n\n5. **Strain the Mixture:** Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly (but do not let it boil). Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any lumps and the vanilla pod.\n\n6. **Cool and Chill:** Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.\n\n7. **Bake the Creme Brulee:** Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Pour the chilled custard into ramekins, filling them about 3/4 full. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly jiggly.\n\n8. **Cool and Set:** Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.\n\n9. **Caramelize the Top:** Before serving, sprinkle each custard with a little extra sugar (about 1 tablespoon per ramekin). Use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar until it forms a golden crust.\n\n10. **Serve:** Serve immediately, allowing the caramel to cool slightly before eating.\n\nEnjoy your delicious Vanilla Creme Brulee!"}]}], "tstamp": 1746647742.7159715, "conv_metadata": {"token_len": 538, "header_count": {"h1": 0, "h2": 0, "h3": 3, "h4": 0, "h5": 0, "h6": 0}, "list_count": {"ordered": 10, "unordered": 10}, "bold_count": {"**": 10, "__": 0}}}
