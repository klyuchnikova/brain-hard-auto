However, these communities also exhibit larger acculturation gaps between existing users and newcomers, which can hinder the integration of new members.\n\n2. **Regularities in Engagement**: By mapping almost 300 Reddit communities, the researchers reveal regularities in how user engagement patterns vary with community characteristics. This suggests that the nature of a community's identity plays a crucial role in how users engage with it.\n\n3. **Consequences for Community Maintainance**: The findings indicate that the way new and existing users engage with a community is strongly and systematically influenced by the collective identity it fosters, which is highly consequential for community maintainers.\n\nThese observations highlight the importance of a community's identity in shaping user engagement and suggest that understanding these dynamics can help in better managing and maintaining online communities."}]}], "tstamp": 1746634588.8394957, "conv_metadata": {"token_len": 215, "header_count": {"h1": 0, "h2": 0, "h3": 0, "h4": 0, "h5": 0, "h6": 0}, "list_count": {"ordered": 3, "unordered": 0}, "bold_count": {"**": 3, "__": 0}}}

If you're using a multi-layer cake, stack the layers and level them if necessary.\n\n4. **Apply the Insert**: Place the cut-out shape on the cake layer. You can use a small amount of frosting to adhere it if needed, but it's often not necessary.\n\n5. **Fill and Frost**: Fill the cake with your desired filling and frost the top and sides.
