Common ratios are:\n   - High protein: 30-35% protein, 40-45% carbs, 25-30% fat\n   - Balanced: 25-30% protein, 40-50% carbs, 20-30% fat\n   - Low carb: 20-25% protein, 5-10% carbs, 60-70% fat\n\n3. **Calculate Macros**:\n   - **Protein**: Total calories from protein = Total calories \u00d7 (Protein percentage / 100)\n   - **Carbs**: Total calories from carbs = Total calories \u00d7 (Carb percentage / 100)\n   - **Fats**: Total calories from fats = Total calories \u00d7 (Fat percentage / 100)\n\n4. **Convert to Grams**:\n   - 1 gram of protein = 4 calories\n   - 1 gram of carbs = 4 calories\n   - 1 gram of fat = 9 calories\n\n   Example: If your total daily calories are 2000 and you want 30% protein:\n   - Protein: (2000 \u00d7 30%) / 4 = 150 grams\n   - Carbs: (2000 \u00d7 40%) / 4 = 200 grams\n   - Fats: (2000 \u00d7 30%) / 9 = 66.67 grams\n\n5. **Adjust as Needed**: Monitor your progress and adjust your macros based on your body's response and goals.\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare provider or a nutritionist for personalized advice."}]}], "tstamp": 1746631695.9360213, "conv_metadata": {"token_len": 390, "header_count": {"h1": 0, "h2": 0, "h3": 0, "h4": 0, "h5": 0, "h6": 0}, "list_count": {"ordered": 5, "unordered": 12}, "bold_count": {"**": 8, "__": 0}}}
