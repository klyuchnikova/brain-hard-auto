### Task
Your task is to evaluate how well the following input prompts can assess the capabilities of advanced AI assistants.
For the input prompt, please analyze it based on the following 7 criteria giving a 1 to 5 mark for each.
1. Specificity
    - Characteristics: whether the question requires a specific output, such as code, a mathematical solution, a logical simplification, a problem-solving strategy, or a hardware setup recommendation. 
    - 1 grade means that the question does not require any specific structure.
    - 5 grade means that the question requires a complex and specific structure such as mentioned.
    - Examples: If answer format is given it's a 5. "Write python implementation of factorial" is 5, "Can you describe an elephant?" is 1.
2. Domain Knowledge
    - Characteristics: whether the question covers a specific domain, such as programming, mathematics, history etc. 
    - 1 grade means that the answer does not require any deep knowledge of a specific domain, common knowledge is enough.
    - 5 grade means that the question touches a range of topics or/and different domains.
    - Examples: "Who was the president of the US in 1975?" is 4 since a medium level specialist would answer, "What is the name of the highest mountain" is 1 since everyone knows that.
3. Complexity
    - Characteristics: whether the question requires a complex, multi-step solution.
    - 1 grade means that the answer does not require any thought process or uncommon knowledge.
    - 5 grade means that the question requires a complex multi step thought.
    - Examples: "What's a python?" is 1. "How can I reload windows?" is 2. Any difficult math / physics task is 5.
4. Problem-Solving Skills
    - Characteristics: whether the answer should demonstrate active problem-solving skills.
    - 1 grade means that the answer does not require any thought process and is regurgitating an existing fact. 
    - 5 grade means that the question requires a complex multi step thought.
    - "Can you name top cat breeds?" is 2 since it almost does not require thought process. "you are given a task to detect number of faces in each frame of any video using pytorch" is 5.
5. Creativity
    - Characteristics: assesses whether the response requires to think up a creative novel approach.
    - 1 grade means that the answer requires a straightforward or factual response with no creativity.
    - 5 grade means that the question invites a highly creative or novel approach, requiring the generation of unique ideas or solutions.
    - Examples: "Can you write code to print hello" is 2. "Can you think of a story ending that goes like this..." is 5.
6. Technical Accuracy
    - Characteristics: assesses the levels of technical accuracy required for technical fields.
    - 1 grade means that the answer can be very general or imprecise, with no need for specific technical accuracy.
    - 5 grade means that the response must be meticulously accurate, reflecting deep technical expertise and attention to detail.
    - Examples: "Can a three year old ride a bysicle" is 1, "How old is Donald Trump?" is 5.
7. Real-world Application
    - Characteristics: how much thr prompt relates to real-world applications.
    - 1 grade means that the question pertains to theoretical knowledge or information with no direct application.
    - 5 grade means that the question demands an actionable solution applicable to real-life situations, requiring practical implementation guidance.
    - Examples: "how much sweets can I eat before I get sick" is 3, "write bash file to start jupyter" is 5.
Do not add anything additional to your answer.
