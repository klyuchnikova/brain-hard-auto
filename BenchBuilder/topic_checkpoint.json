Similar distributed models of word or subword embeddings (or vector representations) find usage in sota, deep neural networks like BERT and its successors (BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3). These deep networks generate contextual representations of words after been trained for extended periods on large corpora, unsupervised, using the attention mechanisms (BIBREF4).\nIt has been observed that various hyper-parameter combinations have been used in different research involving word2vec with the possibility of many of them being sub-optimal (BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7). Therefore, the authors seek to address the research question: what is the optimal combination of word2vec hyper-parameters for intrinsic and extrinsic NLP purposes? There are astronomically high numbers of combinations of hyper-parameters possible for neural networks, even with just a few layers. Hence, the scope of our extensive work over three corpora is on dimension size, training epochs, window size and vocabulary size for the training algorithms (hierarchical softmax and negative sampling) of both skipgram and CBoW. The corpora used for word embeddings are English Wiki News Abstract by BIBREF8 of about 15MB, English Wiki Simple (SW) Articles by BIBREF9 of about 711MB and the Billion Word (BW) of 3.9GB by BIBREF10. The corpus used for sentiment analysis is the IMDb dataset of movie reviews by BIBREF11 while that for NER is Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB) by BIBREF12, containing 47,959 sentence samples. The IMDb dataset used has a total of 25,000 sentences with half being positive sentiments and the other half being negative sentiments. The GMB dataset has 17 labels, with 9 main labels and 2 context tags. It is however unbalanced due to the high percentage of tokens with the label 'O'. This skew in the GMB dataset is typical with NER datasets.\nThe objective of this work is to determine the optimal combinations of word2vec hyper-parameters for intrinsic evaluation (semantic and syntactic analogies) and extrinsic evaluation tasks (BIBREF13, BIBREF14), like SA and NER. It is not our objective in this work to record sota results. Some of the main contributions of this research are the empirical establishment of optimal combinations of word2vec hyper-parameters for NLP tasks, discovering the behaviour of quality of vectors viz-a-viz increasing dimensions and the confirmation of embeddings being task-specific for the downstream. The rest of this paper is organised as follows: the literature review that briefly surveys distributed representation of words, particularly word2vec; the methodology employed in this research work; the results obtained and the conclusion.\nLiterature Review\nBreaking away from the non-distributed (high-dimensional, sparse) representations of words, typical of traditional bag-of-words or one-hot-encoding (BIBREF15), BIBREF0 created word2vec. Word2Vec consists of two shallow neural network architectures: continuous skipgram and CBoW. It uses distributed (low-dimensional, dense) representations of words that group similar words. This new model traded the complexity of deep neural network architectures, by other researchers, for more efficient training over large corpora. Its architectures have two training algorithms: negative sampling and hierarchical softmax (BIBREF16). The released model was trained on Google news dataset of 100 billion words. Implementations of the model have been undertaken by researchers in the programming languages Python and C++, though the original was done in C (BIBREF17).\nContinuous skipgram predicts (by maximizing classification of) words before and after the center word, for a given range. Since distant words are less connected to a center word in a sentence, less weight is assigned to such distant words in trai\nQuestion: What sentiment analysis dataset is used?", "default_answer": "IMDb dataset of movie reviews", "model_answer": "The sentiment analysis dataset used is the IMDb dataset of movie reviews.", "row-id": 24.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The gravitational attraction of the Moon causes tides on Earth.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "Mercury_SC_400039"}, "prompt": "The gravitational attraction of the Moon causes which effect on Earth?", "default_answer": "ocean tides", "model_answer": "The gravitational attraction of the Moon causes tides on Earth.", "row-id": 28.0, "topic": "physics"}, {"specificity": 3.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 4.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "Their model improves interpretability by using adaptively sparse attention heads, which allow low-scoring words to receive zero weight, thus making it clearer which words are being focused on.

Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with $\\alpha$-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the $\\alpha$ parameter -- which controls the shape and sparsity of $\\alpha$-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.\n\nHow does their model improve interpretability compared to softmax transformers?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Their model improves interpretability by using adaptively sparse attention heads, which allow low-scoring words to receive zero weight, thus making it clearer which words are being focused on.

A recent significant improvement in these tasks comes from BERT. As reported, the next sentence prediction (NSP) in BERT, which learns the contextual relationship between two sentences, is of great significance for downstream problems with sentence-pair input. Despite the effectiveness of NSP, we suggest that NSP still lacks the essential signal to distinguish between entailment and shallow correlation. To remedy this, we propose to augment the NSP task to a 3-class categorization task, which includes a category for previous sentence prediction (PSP). The involvement of PSP encourages the model to focus on the informative semantics to determine the sentence order, thereby improves the ability of semantic understanding. This simple modification yields remarkable improvement against vanilla BERT. To further incorporate the document-level information, the scope of NSP and PSP is expanded into a broader range, i.e., NSP and PSP also include close but nonsuccessive sentences, the noise of which is mitigated by the label-smoothing technique. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method consistently improves the performance on the NLI and MRC benchmarks, including the challenging HANS dataset~\\cite{hans}, suggesting that the document-level task is still promising for the pre-training.\n\nWhat BERT model do they test?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper tests a modified BERT model that incorporates symmetric regularization by augmenting the NSP task to include a previous sentence prediction (PSP) category, expanding NSP and PSP to include close but nonsuccessive sentences, and using label-smoothing technique.", "row-id": 79.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The security of a homemade bar attached to a wall depends on various factors such as the materials used, the method of attachment, and the structural integrity of the wall.

Automatically identifying all of these errors is a challenging task, especially as the amount of available annotated data is very limited. Rei2016 showed that while some error detection algorithms perform better than others, it is additional training data that has the biggest impact on improving performance.\nBeing able to generate realistic artificial data would allow for any grammatically correct text to be transformed into annotated examples containing writing errors, producing large amounts of additional training examples. Supervised error generation systems would also provide an efficient method for anonymising the source corpus \u2013 error statistics from a private corpus can be aggregated and applied to a different target text, obscuring sensitive information in the original examination scripts. However, the task of creating incorrect data is somewhat more difficult than might initially appear \u2013 naive methods for error generation can create data that does not resemble natural errors, thereby making downstream systems learn misleading or uninformative patterns.\nPrevious work on artificial error generation (AEG) has focused on specific error types, such as prepositions and determiners BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , or noun number errors BIBREF2 . Felice2014a investigated the use of linguistic information when generating artificial data for error correction, but also restricting the approach to only five error types. There has been very limited research on generating artificial data for all types, which is important for general-purpose error detection systems. For example, the error types investigated by Felice2014a cover only 35.74% of all errors present in the CoNLL 2014 training dataset, providing no additional information for the majority of errors.\nIn this paper, we investigate two supervised approaches for generating all types of artificial errors. We propose a framework for generating errors based on statistical machine translation (SMT), training a model to translate from correct into incorrect sentences. In addition, we describe a method for learning error patterns from an annotated corpus and transplanting them into error-free text. We evaluate the effect of introducing artificial data on two error detection benchmarks. Our results show that each method provides significant improvements over using only the available training set, and a combination of both gives an absolute improvement of 4.3% in INLINEFORM0 , without requiring any additional annotated data.\nError Generation Methods\nWe investigate two alternative methods for AEG. The models receive grammatically correct text as input and modify certain tokens to produce incorrect sequences. The alternative versions of each sentence are aligned using Levenshtein distance, allowing us to identify specific words that need to be marked as errors. While these alignments are not always perfect, we found them to be sufficient for practical purposes, since alternative alignments of similar sentences often result in the same binary labeling. Future work could explore more advanced alignment methods, such as proposed by felice-bryant-briscoe.\nIn Section SECREF4 , this automatically labeled data is then used for training error detection models.\nMachine Translation\nWe treat AEG as a translation task \u2013 given a correct sentence as input, the system would learn to translate it to contain likely errors, based on a training corpus of parallel data. Existing SMT approaches are already optimised for identifying context patterns that correspond to specific output sequences, which is also required for generating human-like errors. The reverse of this idea, translating from incorrect to correct sentences, has been shown to work well for\nQuestion: What are their results on both datasets?", "default_answer": "Combining  pattern based and Machine translation approaches gave the best overall F0.5 scores.

We address the problem of learning novel words by a robot that has no prior knowledge of these words except for a primitive acoustic model. Further, we propose a method that allows a robot to effectively use the learned words and their meanings for self-localization tasks. The proposed method is nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept acquisition method (SpCoA) that integrates the generative model for self-localization and the unsupervised word segmentation in uttered sentences via latent variables related to the spatial concept. We implemented the proposed method SpCoA on SIGVerse, which is a simulation environment, and TurtleBot2, which is a mobile robot in a real environment. Further, we conducted experiments for evaluating the performance of SpCoA. The experimental results showed that SpCoA enabled the robot to acquire the names of places from speech sentences.

As a result, attention is considered to be an alignment model as well. However, there is no work that specifically studies attention and provides analysis of what is being learned by attention models. Thus, the question still remains that how attention is similar or different from the traditional alignment. In this paper, we provide detailed analysis of attention and compare it to traditional alignment. We answer the question of whether attention is only capable of modelling translational equivalent or it captures more information. We show that attention is different from alignment in some cases and is capturing useful information other than alignments.\n\nIn what cases is attention different from alignment?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper suggests that attention is different from alignment in cases where it captures useful information other than just translational equivalents.

With the rise of large digitized text resources recent NLP technologies have made it possible to capture such change with vector space models BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, topic models BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, and sense clustering models BIBREF9. However, many approaches for detecting LSC differ profoundly from each other and therefore drawing comparisons between them can be challenging BIBREF10. Not only do architectures for detecting LSC vary, their performance is also often evaluated without access to evaluation data or too sparse data sets. In cases where evaluation data is available, oftentimes LSCD systems are not evaluated on the same data set which hinders the research community to draw comparisons.\nFor this reason we report the results of the first shared task on unsupervised lexical semantic change detection in German that is based on an annotated data set to guarantee objective reasoning throughout different approaches. The task was organized as part of the seminar 'Lexical Semantic Change Detection' at the IMS Stuttgart in the summer term of 2019.\nTask\nThe goal of the shared task was to create an architecture to detect semantic change and to rank words according to their degree of change between two different time periods. Given two corpora Ca and Cb, the target words had to be ranked according to their degree of lexical semantic change between Ca and Cb as annotated by human judges. A competition was set up on Codalab and teams mostly consisting of 2 people were formed to take part in the task. There was one group consisting of 3 team members and two individuals who entered the task on their own. In total there were 12 LSCD systems participating in the shared task.\nThe shared task was divided into three phases, i.e., development, testing and analysis phase. In the development phase each team implemented a first version of their model based on a trial data set and submitted it subsequently. In the testing phase the testing data was made public and participants applied their models to the test data with a restriction of possible result uploads to 30. The leaderboard was public at all times. Eventually, the analysis phase was entered and the models of the testing phase were evaluated in terms of the predictions they made and parameters could be tuned further. The models and results will be discussed in detail in sections 7 and 8.\nCorpora\nThe task, as framed above, requires to detect the semantic change between two corpora. The two corpora used in the shared task correspond to the diachronic corpus pair from BIBREF0: DTA18 and DTA19. They consist of subparts of DTA corpus BIBREF11 which is a freely available lemmatized, POS-tagged and spelling-normalized diachronic corpus of German containing texts from the 16th to the 20th century. DTA18 contains 26 million sentences published between 1750-1799 and DTA19 40 million between 1850-1899. The corpus version used in the task has the following format: \"year [tab] lemma1 lemma2 lemma3 ...\".\nEvaluation\nThe Diachronic Usage Relatedness (DURel) gold standard data set includes 22 target words and their varying degrees of semantic change BIBREF12. For each of these target words a random sample of use pairs from the DTA corpus was retrieved and annotated. The annotators were required to rate the pairs according to their semantic relatedness on a scale from 1 to 4 (unrelated - identical meanings) for two time periods. The average Spearman's $\\rho $ between the five annotators was 0.66 for 1,320 use paris. The resulting word ranking of the DURel data set is determined by the mean usage relatedness across two time periods and is used as the benchmark to compare the models\u2019 performances in the shared task.\nEvaluation ::: Metric\nThe output of a system with the target words in the predicted order is compared to th\nQuestion: What is the corpus used for the task?", "default_answer": "DTA18, DTA19", "model_answer": "The corpus used for the task is the diachronic corpus pair from BIBREF0: DTA18 and DTA19, which are subparts of the DTA corpus.", "row-id": 174.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To store paper without damage, keep it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

We introduce a neural model which integrates and reasons relying on information spread within documents and across multiple documents. We frame it as an inference problem on a graph. Mentions of entities are nodes of this graph while edges encode relations between different mentions (e.g., within-and crossdocument coreference). Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are applied to these graphs and trained to perform multi-step reasoning. Our Entity-GCN method is scalable and compact, and it achieves state-of-the-art results on a multi-document question answering dataset, WIKIHOP (Welbl et al., 2018).\n\nDid they use a relation extraction method to construct the edges in the graph?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract mentions that edges encode relations between different mentions, but it does not specify whether a relation extraction method was used to construct these edges.", "row-id": 202.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 1.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 3.0, "answer": "Yes", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/flan_v2_converted_1736", "original_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/flan_v2_converted", "question_length": 1911}, "prompt": "Q: Is this product review positive? Title: Based on TV show Review: This game is actually based on characters from an old cartoon show where some kid was hiding aliens which had crash-landed in the top of a lighthouse (hiding them from his mom).The show didn't last long, simply wasn't very good. But this game simply takes the weird little aliens and uses them as props to solve puzzles.I found it very entertaining, a bit cartoon-ish for my age (don't go there). But it was still fun to play. It is purely a puzzle game, and has nothing to do with the old TV show during the play.Good puzzles, not too hard to figure out most of the time, and lots of puzzles to solve.Definitely a good puzzle game to add to your collection if you are a puzzle solving game fan.

As someone else said, I was the Schmuck. The \"storyline\" was non-existent. It was by far the most worthless movie I've ever wasted time watching.The only funny parts of the movie were the bits in the trailer. The actual Dinner for Schmucks was at the end of the movie and the stuff leading up to it was pointless, bizarre junk. I love Steve Carrell, but even he couldn't make this movie worthwhile.

Automatically identifying all of these errors is a challenging task, especially as the amount of available annotated data is very limited. Rei2016 showed that while some error detection algorithms perform better than others, it is additional training data that has the biggest impact on improving performance.\nBeing able to generate realistic artificial data would allow for any grammatically correct text to be transformed into annotated examples containing writing errors, producing large amounts of additional training examples. Supervised error generation systems would also provide an efficient method for anonymising the source corpus \u2013 error statistics from a private corpus can be aggregated and applied to a different target text, obscuring sensitive information in the original examination scripts. However, the task of creating incorrect data is somewhat more difficult than might initially appear \u2013 naive methods for error generation can create data that does not resemble natural errors, thereby making downstream systems learn misleading or uninformative patterns.\nPrevious work on artificial error generation (AEG) has focused on specific error types, such as prepositions and determiners BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , or noun number errors BIBREF2 . Felice2014a investigated the use of linguistic information when generating artificial data for error correction, but also restricting the approach to only five error types. There has been very limited research on generating artificial data for all types, which is important for general-purpose error detection systems. For example, the error types investigated by Felice2014a cover only 35.74% of all errors present in the CoNLL 2014 training dataset, providing no additional information for the majority of errors.\nIn this paper, we investigate two supervised approaches for generating all types of artificial errors. We propose a framework for generating errors based on statistical machine translation (SMT), training a model to translate from correct into incorrect sentences. In addition, we describe a method for learning error patterns from an annotated corpus and transplanting them into error-free text. We evaluate the effect of introducing artificial data on two error detection benchmarks. Our results show that each method provides significant improvements over using only the available training set, and a combination of both gives an absolute improvement of 4.3% in INLINEFORM0 , without requiring any additional annotated data.\nError Generation Methods\nWe investigate two alternative methods for AEG. The models receive grammatically correct text as input and modify certain tokens to produce incorrect sequences. The alternative versions of each sentence are aligned using Levenshtein distance, allowing us to identify specific words that need to be marked as errors. While these alignments are not always perfect, we found them to be sufficient for practical purposes, since alternative alignments of similar sentences often result in the same binary labeling. Future work could explore more advanced alignment methods, such as proposed by felice-bryant-briscoe.\nIn Section SECREF4 , this automatically labeled data is then used for training error detection models.\nMachine Translation\nWe treat AEG as a translation task \u2013 given a correct sentence as input, the system would learn to translate it to contain likely errors, based on a training corpus of parallel data. Existing SMT approaches are already optimised for identifying context patterns that correspond to specific output sequences, which is also required for generating human-like errors. The reverse of this idea, translating from incorrect to correct sentences, has been shown to work well for err\nQuestion: What textual patterns are extracted?", "default_answer": "(VVD shop_VV0 II, VVD shopping_VVG II)", "model_answer": "The textual patterns extracted are context patterns that correspond to specific output sequences, which are used for generating human-like errors in the artificial error generation process.", "row-id": 220.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 4.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Detener el avance de un pa\u00eds en un contexto de 'guerra fr\u00eda' es un tema complejo que involucra m\u00faltiples estrategias diplom\u00e1ticas, econ\u00f3micas y militares.

Memes are pixel-based multimedia documents that contain photos or illustrations together with phrases which, when combined, usually adopt a funny meaning. However, hate memes are also used to spread hate through social networks, so their automatic detection would help reduce their harmful societal impact. Our results indicate that the model can learn to detect some of the memes, but that the task is far from being solved with this simple architecture. While previous work focuses on linguistic hate speech, our experiments indicate how the visual modality can be much more informative for hate speech detection than the linguistic one in memes. In our experiments, we built a dataset of 5,020 memes to train and evaluate a multi-layer perceptron over the visual and language representations, whether independently or fused.

This task requires not only to understand the context clues which play an important role in planning the plot but also to handle implicit knowledge to make a reasonable, coherent story. In this paper, we devise a novel model for story ending generation. The model adopts an incremental encoding scheme to represent context clues which are spanning in the story context. In addition, commonsense knowledge is applied through multi-source attention to facilitate story comprehension, and thus to help generate coherent and reasonable endings. Through building context clues and using implicit knowledge, the model is able to produce reasonable story endings. context clues implied in the post and make the inference based on it.

We experiment with predicting a wide range of 62 demographic attributes for neighbourhoods of London. We use the text from QA platform of Yahoo! Answers and compare our results to the ones obtained from Twitter microblogs. Outcomes show that the correlation between the predicted demographic attributes using text from Yahoo! Answers discussions and the observed demographic attributes can reach an average Pearson correlation coefficient of \\r{ho} = 0.54, slightly higher than the predictions obtained using Twitter data. Our qualitative analysis indicates that there is semantic relatedness between the highest correlated terms extracted from both datasets and their relative demographic attributes. Furthermore, the correlations highlight the different natures of the information contained in Yahoo! Answers and Twitter.

In recent years, Transformer-based models like BERT BIBREF17 and T5 BIBREF18 have yielded state-of-the-art results on the lion's share of benchmark tasks for language understanding through pretraining and transfer, often paired with some form of multitask learning.\njiant enables a variety of complex training pipelines through simple configuration changes, including multi-task training BIBREF19, BIBREF20 and pretraining, as well as the sequential fine-tuning approach from STILTs BIBREF15. In STILTs, intermediate task training takes a pretrained model like ELMo or BERT, and applies supplementary training on a set of intermediate tasks, before finally performing single-task training on additional downstream tasks.\njiant System Overview ::: Requirements\njiant v1.3.0 requires Python 3.5 or later. jiant can be installed via pip, or cloned and installed from GitHub. jiant's core dependencies are PyTorch BIBREF21, AllenNLP BIBREF1, and HuggingFace's Transformers BIBREF0. jiant is released under the MIT License BIBREF22.\njiant System Overview ::: jiant Components\nTasks: Tasks have references to task data, methods for processing data, references to classifier heads, and methods for calculating performance metrics, and making predictions.\nSentence Encoder: Sentence encoders map from the indexed examples to a sentence-level representation. Sentence encoders can include an input module (e.g., Transformer models, ELMo, or word embeddings), followed by an optional second layer of encoding (usually a BiLSTM). Examples of possible sentence encoder config\nQuestion: Is jiant compatible with models in any programming language?", "default_answer": "Yes", "model_answer": "jiant is compatible with models implemented in Python, as it requires Python 3.5 or later and relies on Python libraries such as PyTorch, AllenNLP, and HuggingFace's Transformers.", "row-id": 351.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The students are using the science process of classification when they group the leaves by shape.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "AKDE&ED_2008_4_1"}, "prompt": "Students are studying some leaves.

Our initial visualization of monolingual word embeddings indicates named entities tend to gather together despite of named entity types and language difference, which enable us to model all named entities using a specific geometric structure inside embedding space,namely, the named entity hypersphere. For monolingual case, the proposed named entity model gives an open description on diverse named entity types and different languages.

To the best of our knowledge, UniSent is the largest sentiment resource to date in terms of number of covered languages, including many low resource languages. To create UniSent, we propose Adapted Sentiment Pivot, a novel method that combines annotation projection, vocabulary expansion, and unsupervised domain adaptation.

To help satisfy this elementary requirement, we introduce the initial release of the Taskmaster-1 dataset which includes 13,215 task-based dialogs comprising six domains. Two procedures were used to create this collection, each with unique advantages. The first involves a two-person, spoken \"Wizard of Oz\" (WOz) approach in which trained agents and crowdsourced workers interact to complete the task while the second is \"self-dialog\" in which crowdsourced workers write the entire dialog themselves. We do not restrict the workers to detailed scripts or to a small knowledge base and hence we observe that our dataset contains more realistic and diverse conversations in comparison to existing datasets. We offer several baseline models including state of the art neural seq2seq architectures with benchmark performance as well as qualitative human evaluations. Dialogs are labeled with API calls and arguments, a simple and cost effective approach which avoids the requirement of complex annotation schema. The layer of abstraction between the dialog model and the service provider API allows for a given model to interact with multiple services that provide similar functionally. Finally, the dataset will evoke interest in written vs. spoken language, discourse patterns, error handling and other linguistic phenomena related to dialog system research, development and design.\n\nWhat baseline models are offered?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper offers several baseline models including state of the art neural seq2seq architectures.", "row-id": 387.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 2.0, "answer": "The most likely benefit of the new material is increased durability, leading to longer-lasting fences and potentially lower maintenance costs.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "Mercury_SC_407699"}, "prompt": "A company that makes fences started using a new material instead of wood.

Detection and Characterization of Bots Spreading Religious Hatred in Arabic Social Media\nAbstract: Arabic Twitter space is crawling with bots that fuel political feuds, spread misinformation, and proliferate sectarian rhetoric. While efforts have long existed to analyze and detect English bots, Arabic bot detection and characterization remains largely understudied. In this work, we contribute new insights into the role of bots in spreading religious hatred on Arabic Twitter and introduce a novel regression model that can accurately identify Arabic language bots. Our assessment shows that existing tools that are highly accurate in detecting English bots don't perform as well on Arabic bots. We identify the possible reasons for this poor performance, perform a thorough analysis of linguistic, content, behavioral and network features, and report on the most informative features that distinguish Arabic bots from humans as well as the differences between Arabic and English bots. Our results mark an important step toward understanding the behavior of malicious bots on Arabic Twitter and pave the way for a more effective Arabic bot detection tools.\n\nDo they analyze what type of content Arabic bots spread in comparison to English?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not explicitly state whether they analyze the type of content Arabic bots spread in comparison to English.

Current neural machine translation (NMT) systems translate a text in a conventional sentence-by-sentence fashion, ignoring such cross-sentence links and dependencies. This may lead to generate an incoherent target text for a coherent source text. In order to handle this issue, we propose a cache-based approach to modeling coherence for neural machine translation by capturing contextual information either from recently translated sentences or the entire document. Particularly, we explore two types of caches: a dynamic cache, which stores words from the best translation hypotheses of preceding sentences, and a topic cache, which maintains a set of target-side topical words that are semantically related to the document to be translated. On this basis, we build a new layer to score target words in these two caches with a cache-based neural model. Here the estimated probabilities from the cache-based neural model are combined with NMT probabilities into the final word prediction probabilities via a gating mechanism. Finally, the proposed cache-based neural model is trained jointly with NMT system in an end-to-end manner. Experiments and analysis presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed cache-based model achieves substantial improvements over several state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines.\n\nDid the authors evaluate their system output for coherence?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not explicitly state whether the authors evaluated their system output for coherence, but it mentions that experiments and analysis were conducted, which may imply coherence evaluation.", "row-id": 431.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 3.0, "answer": "The design feature of removing sulfur from emissions helps in reducing the contribution of factories to acid rain.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "Mercury_7026828"}, "prompt": "Modern factories and industrial plants have filters that remove much of the sulfur from their emissions before it reaches the atmosphere.

The Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) challenge, organized as a track of the Dialog System Technology Challenge 7 (DSTC7), proposes a combined task, where a system has to answer questions pertaining to a video given a dialogue with previous question-answer pairs and the video itself. We propose for this task a hierarchical encoder-decoder model which computes a multi-modal embedding of the dialogue context. It first embeds the dialogue history using two LSTMs. We extract video and audio frames at regular intervals and compute semantic features using pre-trained I3D and VGGish models, respectively. Before summarizing both modalities into fixed-length vectors using LSTMs, we use FiLM blocks to condition them on the embeddings of the current question, which allows us to reduce the dimensionality considerably. Finally, we use an LSTM decoder that we train with scheduled sampling and evaluate using beam search. Compared to the modality-fusing baseline model released by the AVSD challenge organizers, our model achieves a relative improvements of more than 16%, scoring 0.36 BLEU-4 and more than 33%, scoring 0.997 CIDEr.\n\nAt which interval do they extract video and audio frames?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper states that video and audio frames are extracted at regular intervals, but it does not specify the exact interval duration.", "row-id": 446.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "A good way to organize baking pans in a small kitchen is to use vertical storage solutions like a pan rack or a file organizer to keep them upright and easily accessible.

Given that a single pretrained model can be fine-tuned to perform well on many different tasks, these networks appear to extract generally useful linguistic features. A natural question is how such networks represent this information internally. This paper describes qualitative and quantitative investigations of one particularly effective model, BERT. At a high level, linguistic features seem to be represented in separate semantic and syntactic subspaces. We find evidence of a fine-grained geometric representation of word senses. We also present empirical descriptions of syntactic representations in both attention matrices and individual word embeddings, as well as a mathematical argument to explain the geometry of these representations.\n\nWhat linguistic features were probed for?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper probed for semantic and syntactic linguistic features, as well as the geometric representation of word senses.", "row-id": 453.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To install a sound bar for your television, follow these general steps: \n1.

In contrast, non-autoregressive seq2seq models generate all tokens in one pass, which leads to increased efficiency through parallel processing on hardware such as GPUs. However, directly modeling the joint distribution of all tokens simultaneously is challenging, and even with increasingly complex model structures accuracy lags significantly behind autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective model for non-autoregressive sequence generation using latent variable models. Specifically, we turn to generative flow, an elegant technique to model complex distributions using neural networks, and design several layers of flow tailored for modeling the conditional density of sequential latent variables. We evaluate this model on three neural machine translation (NMT) benchmark datasets, achieving comparable performance with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive NMT models and almost constant decoding time w.r.t the sequence length.\n\nWhat is the performance difference between proposed method and state-of-the-arts on these datasets?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract states that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive NMT models on the benchmark datasets, but it does not specify the exact performance difference.", "row-id": 535.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "No, the Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, California, while the Brooklyn Bridge is located in New York City, New York.", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "khaimaitien/qa-expert-multi-hop-qa-V1.0", "meta_info": {"tag": "entities-train.json", "src": "gen_qa"}, "prompt": "Is the location of the Golden Gate Bridge the same as the location of the Brooklyn Bridge?", "default_answer": "No, the location of the Golden Gate Bridge is not the same as the location of the Brooklyn Bridge.", "model_answer": "No, the Golden Gate Bridge is located in San Francisco, California, while the Brooklyn Bridge is located in New York City, New York.", "row-id": 538.0, "topic": "history"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The abstract does not specify the exact baseline approaches that the Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM) outperforms.", "tag": "context_based", "source": "allenai/qasper", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "1908.09246"}, "prompt": "You are given a paper:\nTitle: Open Event Extraction from Online Text using a Generative Adversarial Network\nAbstract: To extract the structured representations of open-domain events, Bayesian graphical models have made some progress. However, these approaches typically assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event. While this may be true for short text such as tweets, such an assumption does not generally hold for long text such as news articles. Moreover, Bayesian graphical models often rely on Gibbs sampling for parameter inference which may take long time to converge. To address these limitations, we propose an event extraction model based on Generative Adversarial Nets, called Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM). AEM models an event with a Dirichlet prior and uses a generator network to capture the patterns underlying latent events. A discriminator is used to distinguish documents reconstructed from the latent events and the original documents. A byproduct of the discriminator is that the features generated by the learned discriminator network allow the visualization of the extracted events.

Recently, Caglayan et al. posit that the observed gains are limited mainly due to the very simple, short, repetitive sentences of the Multi30k dataset (the only multimodal MT dataset available at the time), which renders the source text sufficient for context. In this work, we further investigate this hypothesis on a new large scale multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) dataset, How2, which has 1.57 times longer mean sentence length than Multi30k and no repetition. We propose and evaluate three novel fusion techniques, each of which is designed to ensure the utilization of visual context at different stages of the Sequence-to-Sequence transduction pipeline, even under full linguistic context. However, we still obtain only marginal gains under full linguistic context and posit that visual embeddings extracted from deep vision models (ResNet for Multi30k, ResNext for How2) do not lend themselves to increasing the discriminativeness between the vocabulary elements at token level prediction in NMT. We demonstrate this qualitatively by analyzing attention distribution and quantitatively through Principal Component Analysis, arriving at the conclusion that it is the quality of the visual embeddings rather than the length of sentences, which need to be improved in existing MMT datasets.\n\nWhat are 3 novel fusion techniques that are proposed?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper proposes three novel fusion techniques designed to utilize visual context at different stages of the Sequence-to-Sequence transduction pipeline.

In this work, we explore a hybrid approach to goal-oriented dialogue generation that combines retrieval from past history with a hierarchical, neural encoder-decoder architecture. We evaluate this approach in the customer support domain using the Multiwoz dataset (Budzianowski et al., 2018). We show that adding this retrieval step to a hierarchical, neural encoder-decoder architecture leads to significant improvements, including responses that are rated more appropriate and fluent by human evaluators. Finally, we compare our retrieval-based model to various semantically conditioned models explicitly using past dialog act information, and find that our proposed model is competitive with the current state of the art (Chen et al., 2019), while not requiring explicit labels about past machine acts.\n\nwhat semantically conditioned models did they compare with?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper compares their retrieval-based model with various semantically conditioned models that explicitly use past dialog act information, but specific models are not named in the abstract.", "row-id": 726.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The Great Ocean Road offers several scenic views, including the Twelve Apostles, Loch Ard Gorge, London Arch, the Grotto, and the coastal cliffs and beaches along the route.", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "khaimaitien/qa-expert-multi-hop-qa-V1.0", "meta_info": {"tag": "entities-single_train.json", "src": "gen_qa"}, "prompt": "What are the scenic views of the Great Ocean Road?", "default_answer": "The scenic views of the Great Ocean Road include the ocean, towering cliffs, lush rainforests, designated lookout points, and notable landmarks such as the Twelve Apostles rock formations and the Great Otway National Park.", "model_answer": "The Great Ocean Road offers several scenic views, including the Twelve Apostles, Loch Ard Gorge, London Arch, the Grotto, and the coastal cliffs and beaches along the route.", "row-id": 734.0, "topic": "entertainment"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor.", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "khaimaitien/qa-expert-multi-hop-qa-V1.0", "meta_info": {"tag": "musique-single_train.json", "src": "musique"}, "prompt": "Which military force attacked Pearl Harbor?", "default_answer": "The Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor.", "model_answer": "The Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor.", "row-id": 735.0, "topic": "history"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To make equal sized elevation beams, you need to measure and cut each beam to the same length using precise tools such as a tape measure and a saw.

(Watt, 1985)  The founding of this Christian place of worship is associated with St. Nathalan. who lived circa 650 AD.  The structure is alternatively known as Cowie Chapel.\nThe chapel is at the point where the Highland Boundary Fault meets the sea and so is on the dividing line between the highlands and lowlands of Scotland.\n\nArea history\nThe Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan is one of the oldest surviving structures in Kincardineshire.  About one kilometre to the west is the ancient Causey Mounth trackway, which was constructed on high ground to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south of Stonehaven into Aberdeen. This route specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Muchalls Castle and Cowie Castle from the south. (Hogan, 2007) The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the battle of the Civil War in 1639.\n\nSee also\nDoonie Point\nLimpet Burn\nRed Cloak\nPassage 2:\nInverallochy Castle\nInverallochy Castle is a ruined courtyard castle, near the village of Inverallochy in the Buchan area of North-East Scotland, dating to 1504. It lies 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south of Cairnbulg Castle, near Fraserburgh, and formerly stood beside the now-drained Loch of Inverallochy. It was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of North-East Aberdeenshire.\n\nDescription\nThe remains of buildings are arranged around three sides of a courtyard, with a curtain wall across the south side. A tower in the north-east corner remains largely to its full height, while the remaining curtain wall stands up to 10 m high. The internal walls have largely collapsed. Evidence of a larger outer courtyard measuring approximately 60 metres (200 ft) square to the north and east remains. The ruins are protected as a scheduled monument. The castle appears to have all been built at once, and architectural evidence suggests an early 16th-century date. It may have been the work of Sir William Comyn (or Cumyng) of Inverallochy, who was Lord Lyon in 1512\u20131519.\n\nInscribed stone\nUntil the latter half of the 18th century, there was a stone inserted above the entrance, bearing the sculptured arms of the Comyns, with an inscription \"recording that the estate around it was obtained by Jordan Comyn for building the abbey of Deer\".\nPassage 3:\nCowie Bridge\nCowie Bridge is a roadway bridge which carries the B979 across the mouth of the Cowie Water in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  \nHistorically, the area in the vicinity of the Cowie Bridge site has been an old fishing village known as Cowie Village.  Between the Cowie Bridge and the North Sea, a new pedestrian bridge is planned, which will also support a new pipeline structure.  The site of Cowie Bridge is approximately the point of the southern terminus of the Causey Mounth trackway, which was the only available medieval route crossing the coastal Grampian Mountains northerly by way of Muchalls Castle and Gillybrands.\n\nSee also\nCowie Castle\nChapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan\nPassage 4:\nAllardice Castle\nAllardice Castle (also spelled Allardyce) is a sixteenth-century manor house in Kincardineshire, Scotland. It is approximately 1.5 kilometres north-west of the town of Inverbervie.  The Bervie Water flows around Allardice Castle on both sides. Allardice may be viewed as one of a chain of coastal castles; to the north are Dunnottar Castle (ruined), Fetteresso Castle, Cowie Castle (ruined) and Mucha\nQuestion: Cowie Castle at Stonehaven, and Allardice Castle near Inverbervie, are part of a coastal chain of castles in Scotland overlooking which sea?", "default_answer": "North Sea", "model_answer": "Cowie Castle at Stonehaven and Allardice Castle near Inverbervie are part of a coastal chain of castles in Scotland overlooking the North Sea.", "row-id": 795.0, "topic": "history"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 1.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 1.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To make a vegetable salad tastier, you can add ingredients like a flavorful dressing (e.g., balsamic vinaigrette, lemon juice, olive oil), fresh herbs (e.g., basil, cilantro), nuts or seeds (e.g., almonds, sunflower seeds), cheese (e.g., feta, parmesan), or fruits (e.g., berries, apple slices) for extra flavor and texture.", "tag": "physical_reasoning", "source": "ybisk/piqa", "meta_info": null, "prompt": "To make vegetable salad tastier.", "default_answer": "Add some spices to your dressing or toss them into the salad.", "model_answer": "To make a vegetable salad tastier, you can add ingredients like a flavorful dressing (e.g., balsamic vinaigrette, lemon juice, olive oil), fresh herbs (e.g., basil, cilantro), nuts or seeds (e.g., almonds, sunflower seeds), cheese (e.g., feta, parmesan), or fruits (e.g., berries, apple slices) for extra flavor and texture.", "row-id": 799.0, "topic": "cooking"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The corpus characteristics that correlate with more equitable gender balance include whether the speech is elicited or non-elicited, whether the language is low or high resource, and the specific speech task targeted.", "tag": "context_based", "source": "allenai/qasper", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "2003.08132"}, "prompt": "You are given a paper:\nTitle: Gender Representation in Open Source Speech Resources\nAbstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing use of deep-learning architectures, the question of ethics, transparency and fairness of AI systems has become a central concern within the research community.

In contrast, non-autoregressive seq2seq models generate all tokens in one pass, which leads to increased efficiency through parallel processing on hardware such as GPUs. However, directly modeling the joint distribution of all tokens simultaneously is challenging, and even with increasingly complex model structures accuracy lags significantly behind autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective model for non-autoregressive sequence generation using latent variable models. Specifically, we turn to generative flow, an elegant technique to model complex distributions using neural networks, and design several layers of flow tailored for modeling the conditional density of sequential latent variables. We evaluate this model on three neural machine translation (NMT) benchmark datasets, achieving comparable performance with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive NMT models and almost constant decoding time w.r.t the sequence length.\n\nWhat non autoregressive NMT models are used for comparison?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify which non-autoregressive NMT models are used for comparison.

We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets.

We first manually annotate the semantic roles for a set of learner texts to derive a gold standard for automatic SRL. Based on the new data, we then evaluate three off-the-shelf SRL systems, i.e., the PCFGLA-parser-based, neural-parser-based and neural-syntax-agnostic systems, to gauge how successful SRL for learner Chinese can be. We find two non-obvious facts: 1) the L1-sentence-trained systems performs rather badly on the L2 data; 2) the performance drop from the L1 data to the L2 data of the two parser-based systems is much smaller, indicating the importance of syntactic parsing in SRL for interlanguages. Finally, the paper introduces a new agreement-based model to explore the semantic coherency information in the large-scale L2-L1 parallel data. We then show such information is very effective to enhance SRL for learner texts.

A common paradigm is to pre-train a feature extractor on large amounts of data then fine-tune it as part of a deep learning model on some downstream task (i.e. transfer learning). While effective, feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning (30-40\\%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets, leading to further degradation. Finally, we observe that fine-tuning BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability. We conclude that BERT can be pruned once during pre-training rather than separately for each task without affecting performance.\n\nHow they observe that fine-tuning BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper likely observes that fine-tuning BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability by conducting experiments where BERT is fine-tuned on specific tasks and then pruned, comparing the performance and prunability metrics to those of BERT pruned during pre-training.

Word embeddings are substantially successful in capturing semantic relations among words, so a meaningful semantic structure must be present in the respective vector spaces. However, in many cases, this semantic structure is broadly and heterogeneously distributed across the embedding dimensions, which makes interpretation a big challenge. In this study, we propose a statistical method to uncover the latent semantic structure in the dense word embeddings. To perform our analysis we introduce a new dataset (SEMCAT) that contains more than 6500 words semantically grouped under 110 categories. We further propose a method to quantify the interpretability of the word embeddings; the proposed method is a practical alternative to the classical word intrusion test that requires human intervention.\n\nWhat advantages does their proposed method of quantifying interpretability have over the human-in-the-loop evaluation they compare to?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The proposed method of quantifying interpretability offers advantages such as being a practical alternative to the classical word intrusion test, which requires human intervention.

Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of incorporating gloss (sense definition) into neural networks for WSD. However, compared with traditional word expert supervised methods, they have not achieved much improvement. In this paper, we focus on how to better leverage gloss knowledge in a supervised neural WSD system. We construct context-gloss pairs and propose three BERT-based models for WSD.

This re-representation process essentially maps those variables into a latent space called the \\emph{embedding space}. The benefit of this is that such spaces allow for richer nuances than the typical transformations used in categorical variables (e.g. dummy encoding, contrasted encoding, principal components analysis). While the usage of latent variable representations is not new per se in travel demand modeling, the idea presented here brings several innovations: it is an entirely data driven algorithm; it is informative and consistent, since the latent space can be visualized and interpreted based on distances between different categories; it preserves interpretability of coefficients, despite being based on Neural Network principles; and it is transferrable, in that embeddings learned from one dataset can be reused for other ones, as long as travel behavior keeps consistent between the datasets.  ::: The idea is strongly inspired on natural language processing techniques, namely the word2vec algorithm. Such algorithm is behind recent developments such as in automatic translation or next word prediction. Our method is demonstrated using a model choice model, and shows improvements of up to 60\\% with respect to initial likelihood, and up to 20% with respect to likelihood of the corresponding traditional model (i.e. using dummy variables) in out-of-sample evaluation. We provide a new Python package, called PyTre (PYthon TRavel Embeddings), that others can straightforwardly use to replicate our results or improve their own models. Our experiments are themselves based on an open dataset (swissmetro).\n\nHow do they model travel behavior?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "They model travel behavior using travel behavior embeddings, which map discrete variables into a latent space called the embedding space.

For example, eating disorders in Spanish language Twitter tweets BIBREF0 and influenza surveillance BIBREF1 . More recently, social media has been leveraged to monitor social risks such as prescription drug and smoking behaviors BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 as well as a variety of mental health disorders including suicidal ideation BIBREF5 , attention deficient hyperactivity disorder BIBREF6 and major depressive disorder BIBREF7 . In the case of major depressive disorder, recent efforts range from characterizing linguistic phenomena associated with depression BIBREF8 and its subtypes e.g., postpartum depression BIBREF5 , to identifying specific depressive symptoms BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 e.g., depressed mood. However, more research is needed to better understand the predictive power of supervised machine learning classifiers and the influence of feature groups and feature sets for efficiently classifying depression-related tweets to support mental health monitoring at the population-level BIBREF11 .\nThis paper builds upon related works toward classifying Twitter tweets representing symptoms of major depressive disorder by assessing the contribution of lexical features (e.g., unigrams) and emotion (e.g., strongly negative) to classification performance, and by applying methods to eliminate low-value features.\nMETHODS\nSpecifically, we conducted a feature ablation study to assess the informativeness of each feature group and a feature elimination study to determine the optimal feature sets for classifying Twitter tweets. We leveraged an existing, annotated Twitter dataset that was constructed based on a hierarchical model of depression-related symptoms BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . The dataset contains 9,473 annotations for 9,300 tweets. Each tweet is annotated as no evidence of depression (e.g., \u201cCitizens fear an economic depression\") or evidence of depression (e.g., \u201cdepressed over disappointment\"). If a tweet is annotated evidence of depression, then it is further annotated with one or more depressive symptoms, for example, depressed mood (e.g., \u201cfeeling down in the dumps\"), disturbed sleep (e.g., \u201canother restless night\"), or fatigue or loss of energy (e.g., \u201cthe fatigue is unbearable\") BIBREF10 . For each class, every annotation (9,473 tweets) is binarized as the positive class e.g., depressed mood=1 or negative class e.g., not depressed mood=0.\nFeatures\nFurthermore, this dataset was encoded with 7 feature groups with associated feature values binarized (i.e., present=1 or absent=0) to represent potentially informative features for classifying depression-related classes. We describe the feature groups by type, subtype, and provide one or more examples of words representing the feature subtype from a tweet:\nlexical features, unigrams, e.g., \u201cdepressed\u201d;\nsyntactic features, parts of speech, e.g., \u201ccried\u201d encoded as V for verb;\nemotion features, emoticons, e.g., :( encoded as SAD;\ndemographic features, age and gender e.g., \u201cthis semester\u201d encoded as an indicator of 19-22 years of age and \u201cmy girlfriend\u201d encoded as an indicator of male gender, respectively;\nsentiment features, polarity and subjectivity terms with strengths, e.g., \u201cterrible\u201d encoded as strongly negative and strongly subjective;\npersonality traits, neuroticism e.g., \u201cpissed off\u201d implies neuroticism;\nLIWC Features, indicators of an individual's thoughts, feelings, personality, and motivations, e.g., \u201cfeeling\u201d suggestions perception, feeling, insight, and cognitive mechanisms experienced by the Twitter user.\nA more detailed description of leveraged features and their values, including LIWC categories, can be found in BIBREF10 .\nBased on our prior initial experiments using these feature groups BIBREF10 , we learned that support vector machines perform with the highest F1-sc\nQuestion: What dataset is used for this study?", "default_answer": "BIBREF12 , BIBREF13", "model_answer": "The study uses an existing, annotated Twitter dataset that was constructed based on a hierarchical model of depression-related symptoms, containing 9,473 annotations for 9,300 tweets.", "row-id": 1018.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To stop your shoes from smelling bad, you can try the following methods: \n1.

Each pathology report has a retention period of up to 20 years after the treatment of a patient. Cancer registries process and encode high volumes of free-text pathology reports for surveillance of cancer and tumor diseases all across the world. In spite of their extremely valuable information they hold, pathology reports are not used in any systematic way to facilitate computational pathology. Therefore, in this study, we investigate automated machine-learning techniques to identify/predict the primary diagnosis (based on ICD-O code) from pathology reports. We performed experiments by extracting the TF-IDF features from the reports and classifying them using three different methods---SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. We constructed a new dataset with 1,949 pathology reports arranged into 37 ICD-O categories, collected from four different primary sites, namely lung, kidney, thymus, and testis. The reports were manually transcribed into text format after collecting them as PDF files from NCI Genomic Data Commons public dataset. We subsequently pre-processed the reports by removing irrelevant textual artifacts produced by OCR software. The highest classification accuracy we achieved was 92\\% using XGBoost classifier on TF-IDF feature vectors, the linear SVM scored 87\\% accuracy. Furthermore, the study shows that TF-IDF vectors are suitable for highlighting the important keywords within a report which can be helpful for the cancer research and diagnostic workflow. The results are encouraging in demonstrating the potential of machine learning methods for classification and encoding of pathology reports.\n\nWhat features are used?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The features used are TF-IDF features extracted from the pathology reports.", "row-id": 1119.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "As of the latest available data, Union Pacific Railroad generally has a larger annual revenue compared to Canadian National Railway.

Inspired by the success of the DenseNet model in computer vision problems, in this paper, we propose a densely connected NMT architecture (DenseNMT) that is able to train more efficiently for NMT. The proposed DenseNMT not only allows dense connection in creating new features for both encoder and decoder, but also uses the dense attention structure to improve attention quality.

While EHRs contain medical billing codes that aim to represent the conditions and treatments patients may have, much of the information is only present in the patient notes. Therefore, it is critical to develop robust algorithms to infer patients' conditions and treatments from their written notes. In this paper, we introduce a dataset for patient phenotyping, a task that is defined as the identification of whether a patient has a given medical condition (also referred to as clinical indication or phenotype) based on their patient note. Nursing Progress Notes and Discharge Summaries from the Intensive Care Unit of a large tertiary care hospital were manually annotated for the presence of several high-context phenotypes relevant to treatment and risk of re-hospitalization. This dataset contains 1102 Discharge Summaries and 1000 Nursing Progress Notes. Each Discharge Summary and Progress Note has been annotated by at least two expert human annotators (one clinical researcher and one resident physician). Annotated phenotypes include treatment non-adherence, chronic pain, advanced/metastatic cancer, as well as 10 other phenotypes.

However, this vocabulary set may still include words that interfere with learning in encoder-decoder models. This paper proposes a method for selecting more suitable words for learning encoders by utilizing not only frequency, but also co-occurrence information, which we capture using the HITS algorithm. We apply our proposed method to two tasks: machine translation and grammatical error correction. For Japanese-to-English translation, this method achieves a BLEU score that is 0.56 points more than that of a baseline. It also outperforms the baseline method for English grammatical error correction, with an F0.5-measure that is 1.48 points higher.\n\nSo we do not use pre-trained embedding in this case?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not explicitly mention the use of pre-trained embeddings.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a large scale human annotated real-world QA dataset WebQA with more than 42k questions and 556k evidences. As existing neural QA methods resolve QA either as sequence generation or classification/ranking problem, they face challenges of expensive softmax computation, unseen answers handling or separate candidate answer generation component. In this work, we cast neural QA as a sequence labeling problem and propose an end-to-end sequence labeling model, which overcomes all the above challenges. Experimental results on WebQA show that our model outperforms the baselines significantly with an F1 score of 74.69% with word-based input, and the performance drops only 3.72 F1 points with more challenging character-based input.\n\nWhat are the baselines?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify the exact baselines used for comparison in the study.", "row-id": 1239.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "You can amplify your phone's speakers without electrical magnification by using physical methods such as placing the phone in a bowl or cup to naturally amplify the sound, using a cardboard tube or a paper cone to direct the sound, or placing the phone on a hard surface to reflect the sound waves.", "tag": "physical_reasoning", "source": "ybisk/piqa", "meta_info": null, "prompt": "How can I amplify my phones speakers without electrical magnification?", "default_answer": "Put your phone into a drinking glass or a bowl, face the phone toward yourself  to boost the volume of its speakers.", "model_answer": "You can amplify your phone's speakers without electrical magnification by using physical methods such as placing the phone in a bowl or cup to naturally amplify the sound, using a cardboard tube or a paper cone to direct the sound, or placing the phone on a hard surface to reflect the sound waves.", "row-id": 1240.0, "topic": "engineering"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The abstract does not specify whether the OpenIE systems were more accurate on some scientific disciplines than others.

OIE is often used as a starting point for a number of downstream tasks including knowledge base construction, relation extraction, and question answering. While OIE methods are targeted at being domain independent, they have been evaluated primarily on newspaper, encyclopedic or general web text. In this article, we evaluate the performance of OIE on scientific texts originating from 10 different disciplines. To do so, we use two state-of-the-art OIE systems applying a crowd-sourcing approach. We find that OIE systems perform significantly worse on scientific text than encyclopedic text. We also provide an error analysis and suggest areas of work to reduce errors.

Intuitively, if individuals are represented as vectors, we can think of categories as (soft) regions in the embedding space. Unfortunately, meaningful regions can be difficult to estimate, especially since we often have few examples of individuals that belong to a given category. To address this issue, we rely on the fact that different categories are often highly interdependent. In particular, categories often have conceptual neighbors, which are disjoint from but closely related to the given category (e.g.\\ fruit and vegetable). Our hypothesis is that more accurate category representations can be learned by relying on the assumption that the regions representing such conceptual neighbors should be adjacent in the embedding space. We propose a simple method for identifying conceptual neighbors and then show that incorporating these conceptual neighbors indeed leads to more accurate region based representations.\n\nWhat experiments they perform to demonstrate that their approach leads more accurate region based representations?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify the exact experiments performed to demonstrate the accuracy of their approach.

If the language of a piece of text is known then the appropriate downstream models like parts of speech taggers and language models can be applied as required.\nLID is further also an important step in harvesting scarce language resources. Harvested data can be used to bootstrap more accurate LID models and in doing so continually improve the quality of the harvested data. Availability of data is still one of the big roadblocks for applying data driven approaches like supervised machine learning in developing countries.\nHaving 11 official languages of South Africa has lead to initiatives (discussed in the next section) that have had positive effect on the availability of language resources for research. However, many of the South African languages are still under resourced from the point of view of building data driven models for machine comprehension and process automation.\nTable TABREF2 shows the percentages of first language speakers for each of the official languages of South Africa. These are four conjunctively written Nguni languages (zul, xho, nbl, ssw), Afrikaans (afr) and English (eng), three disjunctively written Sotho languages (nso, sot, tsn), as well as tshiVenda (ven) and Xitsonga (tso). The Nguni languages are similar to each other and harder to distinguish. The same is true of the Sotho languages.\nThis paper presents a hierarchical naive Bayesian and lexicon based classifier for LID of short pieces of text of 15-20 characters long. The algorithm is evaluated against recent approaches using existing test sets from previous works on South African languages as well as the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) 2015 and 2017 shared tasks.\nSection SECREF2 reviews existing works on the topic and summarises the remaining research problems. Section SECREF3 of the paper discusses the proposed algorithm and Section SECREF4 presents comparative results.\nRelated Works\nThe focus of this section is on recently published datasets and LID research applicable to the South African context. An in depth survey of algorithms, features, datasets, shared tasks and evaluation methods may be found in BIBREF0.\nThe datasets for the DSL 2015 & DSL 2017 shared tasks BIBREF1 are often used in LID benchmarks and also available on Kaggle . The DSL datasets, like other LID datasets, consists of text sentences labelled by language. The 2017 dataset, for example, contains 14 languages over 6 language groups with 18000 training samples and 1000 testing samples per language.\nThe recently published JW300 parallel corpus BIBREF2 covers over 300 languages with around 100 thousand parallel sentences per language pair on average. In South Africa, a multilingual corpus of academic texts produced by university students with different mother tongues is being developed BIBREF3. The WiLI-2018 benchmark dataset BIBREF4 for monolingual written natural language identification includes around 1000 paragraphs of 235 languages. A possibly useful link can also be made BIBREF5 between Native Language Identification (NLI) (determining the native language of the author of a text) and Language Variety Identification (LVI) (classification of different varieties of a single language) which opens up more datasets. The Leipzig Corpora Collection BIBREF6, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Tatoeba are also often used sources of data.\nThe NCHLT text corpora BIBREF7 is likely a good starting point for a shared LID task dataset for the South African languages BIBREF8. The NCHLT text corpora contains enough data to have 3500 training samples and 600 testing samples of 300+ character sentences per language. Researchers have recently started applying existing algorithms for tasks like neural machine translation in earnest to such South African language dataset\nQuestion: Which languages are similar to each other?", "default_answer": "Nguni languages (zul, xho, nbl, ssw), Sotho languages (nso, sot, tsn)", "model_answer": "The Nguni languages (zul, xho, nbl, ssw) are similar to each other, and the Sotho languages (nso, sot, tsn) are also similar to each other.", "row-id": 1246.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 1.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 1.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To investigate something, start by defining the problem or question clearly.

Current neural encoder-decoder models conflate both steps into a black-box architecture. As a result, the content to be described in the text cannot be explicitly controlled. This paper tackles this problem by decoupling content selection from the decoder. The decoupled content selection is human interpretable, whose value can be manually manipulated to control the content of generated text. The model can be trained end-to-end without human annotations by maximizing a lower bound of the marginal likelihood. We further propose an effective way to trade-off between performance and controllability with a single adjustable hyperparameter. In both data-to-text and headline generation tasks, our model achieves promising results, paving the way for controllable content selection in text generation.\n\nDoes the performance necessarily drop when more control is desired?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract suggests that there is a trade-off between performance and controllability, which implies that performance may drop when more control is desired.

Many feature based and end-to-end neural nets based satirical news detection systems have been proposed and delivered promising results. Existing approaches explore comprehensive word features from satirical news articles, but lack semantic metrics using word vectors for tweet form satirical news. Moreover, the vagueness of satire and news parody determines that a news tweet can hardly be classified with a binary decision, that is, satirical or legitimate. To address these issues, we collect satirical and legitimate news tweets, and propose a semantic feature based approach. Features are extracted by exploring inconsistencies in phrases, entities, and between main and relative clauses. We apply game-theoretic rough set model to detect satirical news, in which probabilistic thresholds are derived by game equilibrium and repetition learning mechanism. Experimental results on the collected dataset show the robustness and improvement of the proposed approach compared with Pawlak rough set model and SVM.\n\nWhat features do they extract?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The features extracted include inconsistencies in phrases, entities, and between main and relative clauses.", "row-id": 1291.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 4.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The correlation demonstrates that text from Yahoo!

In this paper, we showcase how BERT can be usefully applied in text summarization and propose a general framework for both extractive and abstractive models. We introduce a novel document-level encoder based on BERT which is able to express the semantics of a document and obtain representations for its sentences. Our extractive model is built on top of this encoder by stacking several inter-sentence Transformer layers. For abstractive summarization, we propose a new fine-tuning schedule which adopts different optimizers for the encoder and the decoder as a means of alleviating the mismatch between the two (the former is pretrained while the latter is not). We also demonstrate that a two-staged fine-tuning approach can further boost the quality of the generated summaries. Experiments on three datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results across the board in both extractive and abstractive settings.

The science community has been working very actively to understand this new disease and make diagnosis and treatment guidelines based on the findings. One major stream of efforts are focused on discovering the correlation between radiological findings in the lung areas and COVID-19. There have been several works BIBREF0, BIBREF1 publishing such results. However, existing studies are mostly conducted separately by different hospitals and medical institutes. Due to geographic affinity, the populations served by different hospitals have different genetic, social, and ethnic characteristics. As a result, the radiological findings from COVID-19 patient cases in different populations are different. This population bias incurs inconsistent or even conflicting conclusions regarding the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. As a result, medical professionals cannot make informed decisions on how to use radiological findings to guide diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.\nWe aim to address this issue. Our research goal is to develop natural language processing methods to collectively analyze the study results reported by many hospitals and medical institutes all over the world, reconcile these results, and make a holistic and unbiased conclusion regarding the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. Specifically, we take the CORD-19 dataset BIBREF2, which contains over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. We develop sentence classification methods to identify all sentences narrating radiological findings from COVID-19. Then constituent parsing is utilized to identify all noun phrases from these sentences and these noun phrases contain abnormalities, lesions, diseases identified by radiology imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT). We calculate the frequency of these noun phrases and select those with top frequencies for medical professionals to further investigate. Since these clinical entities are aggregated from a number of hospitals all over the world, the population bias is largely mitigated and the conclusions are more objective and universally informative. From the CORD-19 dataset, our method successfully discovers a set of clinical findings that are closely related with COVID-19.\nThe major contributions of this paper include:\nWe develop natural language processing methods to perform unbiased study of the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19.\nWe develop a bootstrapping approach to effectively train a sentence classifier with light-weight manual annotation effort. The sentence classifier is used to extract radiological findings from a vast amount of literature.\nWe conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. From the CORD-19 dataset, our method successfully discovers a set of clinical findings that are closely related with COVID-19.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the data. Section 3 presents the method. Section 4 gives experimental results. Section 5 concludes the paper.\nDataset\nWe used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) BIBREF2 for our study. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of research groups prepared the CORD-19 dataset. It contains over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. These articles are contributed by hospitals and medical institutes all over the world. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 is after November 2019, we select articles published after November 2019 to study, which include a total of 2081 articles and about 360000 sente\nQuestion: How large is the collection of COVID-19 literature?", "default_answer": "45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text", "model_answer": "The collection of COVID-19 literature, as mentioned in the context, is the CORD-19 dataset which contains over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text.", "row-id": 1367.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 4.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) was founded in 1972.

Specifically, we treat \\textit{facet} instead of \\textit{token} as the basic unit for evaluation, manually annotate the \\textit{support sentences} for each facet, and directly evaluate extractive methods by comparing the indices of extracted sentences with support sentences.

However NMT systems with deep architecture in their encoder or decoder RNNs often suffer from severe gradient diffusion due to the non-linear recurrent activations, which often make the optimization much more difficult. To address this problem we propose novel linear associative units (LAU) to reduce the gradient propagation length inside the recurrent unit. Different from conventional approaches (LSTM unit and GRU), LAUs utilizes linear associative connections between input and output of the recurrent unit, which allows unimpeded information flow through both space and time direction. The model is quite simple, but it is surprisingly effective. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows that our model with proper configuration can improve by 11.7 BLEU upon Groundhog and the best reported results in the same setting. On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14 English-French task, our model achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art.\n\nDo they use the same architecture as LSTM-s and GRUs with just replacing with the LAU unit?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper suggests that they use a similar architecture to LSTMs and GRUs but replace the recurrent unit with the Linear Associative Unit (LAU) to address gradient diffusion issues.", "row-id": 1483.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "You can substitute milk in a smoothie with various alternatives such as almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, oat milk, or even juice or water, depending on your taste preference and dietary needs.", "tag": "physical_reasoning", "source": "ybisk/piqa", "meta_info": null, "prompt": "How do you substitute milk when making a smoothie?", "default_answer": "Replace regular milk with soy milk or almond milk when making a smoothie.", "model_answer": "You can substitute milk in a smoothie with various alternatives such as almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, oat milk, or even juice or water, depending on your taste preference and dietary needs.", "row-id": 1490.0, "topic": "cooking"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Redis \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5468\u62a5\u793a\u4f8b\uff1a\n\n\u672c\u5468\u5de5\u4f5c\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\n\n1. \u91cd\u6784\uff1a\n   -

For the purpose of training a hate speech detection system, the reliability of the annotations is crucial, but there is no universally agreed-upon definition. We collected potentially hateful messages and asked two groups of internet users to determine whether they were hate speech or not, whether they should be banned or not and to rate their degree of offensiveness. One of the groups was shown a definition prior to completing the survey. We aimed to assess whether hate speech can be annotated reliably, and the extent to which existing definitions are in accordance with subjective ratings. Our results indicate that showing users a definition caused them to partially align their own opinion with the definition but did not improve reliability, which was very low overall.

Aiming to address this issue for French, we release CamemBERT, a French version of the Bi-directional Encoders for Transformers (BERT). We measure the performance of CamemBERT compared to multilingual models in multiple downstream tasks, namely part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named-entity recognition, and natural language inference. CamemBERT improves the state of the art for most of the tasks considered. We release the pretrained model for CamemBERT hoping to foster research and downstream applications for French NLP.\n\nWhich tasks does CamemBERT not improve on?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify which tasks CamemBERT does not improve on.

By using an attention mechanism, the model is able to dynamically decide how much information to use from a word- or character-level component. We evaluated different architectures on a range of sequence labeling datasets, and character-level extensions were found to improve performance on every benchmark.

As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos and posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter, demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the twitter messages related to this disease posted since January 2020. Two types of empirical studies have been performed. The first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual tweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing the patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect on the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram, bigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The results have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). High values of R2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the grounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The results showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only about 15% were negative.\n\nDo the authors give examples of positive and negative sentiment with regard to the virus?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not provide specific examples of positive and negative sentiment with regard to the virus.", "row-id": 1647.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 4.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 3.0, "answer": "yes", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/flan_v2_converted_196", "original_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/flan_v2_converted", "question_length": 347}, "prompt": "Q: In this task, you are given a pair of action statements.

Previous work models the whole dialog to predict dialog acts, which may bring the noise from unrelated sentences. In this work, we design a hierarchical model based on self-attention to capture intra-sentence and inter-sentence information. We revise the attention distribution to focus on the local and contextual semantic information by incorporating the relative position information between utterances. Based on the found that the length of dialog affects the performance, we introduce a new dialog segmentation mechanism to analyze the effect of dialog length and context padding length under online and offline settings. The experiment shows that our method achieves promising performance on two datasets: Switchboard Dialogue Act and DailyDialog with the accuracy of 80.34\\% and 85.81\\% respectively.

Each project also provides corpora of annotated text in many languages - UD at the token level and UniMorph at the type level. As each corpus is built by different annotators, language-specific decisions hinder the goal of universal schemata. With compatibility of tags, each project's annotations could be used to validate the other's. Additionally, the availability of both type- and token-level resources would be a boon to tasks such as parsing and homograph disambiguation. To ease this interoperability, we present a deterministic mapping from Universal Dependencies v2 features into the UniMorph schema. We validate our approach by lookup in the UniMorph corpora and find a macro-average of 64.13% recall. We also note incompatibilities due to paucity of data on either side.

In particular, Transformer, which is solely based on self-attention, has led to breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, the multi-head attention mechanism, as a key component of Transformer, limits the effective deployment of the model to a limited resource setting. In this paper, based on the ideas of tensor decomposition and parameters sharing, we propose a novel self-attention model (namely Multi-linear attention) with Block-Term Tensor Decomposition (BTD). We test and verify the proposed attention method on three language modeling tasks (i.e., PTB, WikiText-103 and One-billion) and a neural machine translation task (i.e., WMT-2016 English-German).

As a step towards full decoding of imagined speech from active thoughts, we present a BCI system for subject-independent classification of phonological categories exploiting a novel deep learning based hierarchical feature extraction scheme. To better capture the complex representation of high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG) data, we compute the joint variability of EEG electrodes into a channel cross-covariance matrix. We then extract the spatio-temporal information encoded within the matrix using a mixed deep neural network strategy. Our model framework is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long-short term network (LSTM), and a deep autoencoder. We train the individual networks hierarchically, feeding their combined outputs in a final gradient boosting classification step. Our best models achieve an average accuracy of 77.9% across five different binary classification tasks, providing a significant 22.5% improvement over previous methods.

Detection and Characterization of Bots Spreading Religious Hatred in Arabic Social Media\nAbstract: Arabic Twitter space is crawling with bots that fuel political feuds, spread misinformation, and proliferate sectarian rhetoric. While efforts have long existed to analyze and detect English bots, Arabic bot detection and characterization remains largely understudied. In this work, we contribute new insights into the role of bots in spreading religious hatred on Arabic Twitter and introduce a novel regression model that can accurately identify Arabic language bots. Our assessment shows that existing tools that are highly accurate in detecting English bots don't perform as well on Arabic bots. We identify the possible reasons for this poor performance, perform a thorough analysis of linguistic, content, behavioral and network features, and report on the most informative features that distinguish Arabic bots from humans as well as the differences between Arabic and English bots. Our results mark an important step toward understanding the behavior of malicious bots on Arabic Twitter and pave the way for a more effective Arabic bot detection tools.\n\nDo they propose a new model to better detect Arabic bots specifically?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Yes, they introduce a novel regression model that can accurately identify Arabic language bots.", "row-id": 1822.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 4.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The processor type of the Apple MacBook Pro varies by model and year.

In an end-to-end dialog system, the aim of dialog state tracking is to accurately estimate the true dialog state from noisy observations produced by the speech recognition and the natural language understanding modules. The state tracking task is primarily meant to support a dialog policy. From a probabilistic perspective, this is achieved by maintaining a posterior distribution over hidden dialog states composed of a set of context dependent variables. Once a dialog policy is learned, it strives to select an optimal dialog act given the estimated dialog state and a defined reward function. This paper introduces a novel method of dialog state tracking based on a bilinear algebric decomposition model that provides an efficient inference schema through collective matrix factorization. We evaluate the proposed approach on the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset and we show that the proposed tracker gives encouraging results compared to the state-of-the-art trackers that participated in this standard benchmark. Finally, we show that the prediction schema is computationally efficient in comparison to the previous approaches.\n\nWhat state-of-the-art models are compared against?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify the state-of-the-art models that are compared against in the paper.", "row-id": 1842.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 3.0, "domain_knowledge": 4.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The text does not explicitly mention building a model to automatically detect demographic, linguistic, or psychological dimensions of people.

Blogging has progressively been used by individuals to share news, ideas, and information, but it has also developed a mainstream role to the extent that it is being used by political consultants and news services as a tool for outreach and opinion forming as well as by businesses as a marketing tool to promote products and services BIBREF0 .\nFor this paper, we compiled a very large geolocated collection of blogs, written by individuals located in the U.S., with the purpose of creating insightful mappings of the blogging community. In particular, during May-July 2015, we gathered the profile information for all the users that have self-reported their location in the U.S., along with a number of posts for all their associated blogs. We utilize this blog collection to generate maps of the U.S. that reflect user demographics, language use, and distributions of psycholinguistic and semantic word classes. We believe that these maps can provide valuable insights and partial verification of previous claims in support of research in linguistic geography BIBREF1 , regional personality BIBREF2 , and language analysis BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , as well as psychology and its relation to human geography BIBREF5 .\nData Collection\nOur premise is that we can generate informative maps using geolocated information available on social media; therefore, we guide the blog collection process with the constraint that we only accept blogs that have specific location information. Moreover, we aim to find blogs belonging to writers from all 50 U.S. states, which will allow us to build U.S. maps for various dimensions of interest.\nWe first started by collecting a set of profiles of bloggers that met our location specifications by searching individual states on the profile finder on http://www.blogger.com. Starting with this list, we can locate the profile page for a user, and subsequently extract additional information, which includes fields such as name, email, occupation, industry, and so forth. It is important to note that the profile finder only identifies users that have an exact match to the location specified in the query; we thus built and ran queries that used both state abbreviations (e.g., TX, AL), as well as the states' full names (e.g., Texas, Alabama).\nAfter completing all the processing steps, we identified 197,527 bloggers with state location information. For each of these bloggers, we found their blogs (note that a blogger can have multiple blogs), for a total of 335,698 blogs. For each of these blogs, we downloaded the 21 most recent blog postings, which were cleaned of HTML tags and tokenized, resulting in a collection of 4,600,465 blog posts.\nMaps from Blogs\nOur dataset provides mappings between location, profile information, and language use, which we can leverage to generate maps that reflect demographic, linguistic, and psycholinguistic properties of the population represented in the dataset.\nPeople Maps\nThe first map we generate depicts the distribution of the bloggers in our dataset across the U.S. Figure FIGREF1 shows the density of users in our dataset in each of the 50 states. For instance, the densest state was found to be California with 11,701 users. The second densest is Texas, with 9,252 users, followed by New York, with 9,136. The state with the fewest bloggers is Delaware with 1,217 users. Not surprisingly, this distribution correlates well with the population of these states, with a Spearman's rank correlation INLINEFORM0 of 0.91 and a p-value INLINEFORM1 0.0001, and is very similar to the one reported in Lin and Halavais Lin04.\nFigure FIGREF1 also shows the cities mentioned most often in our dataset.

The lack of any supervision makes such approaches conceptually attractive. Yet, their only core difference from (weakly) supervised projection-based CLWE methods is in the way they obtain a seed dictionary used to initialize an iterative self-learning procedure. The fully unsupervised methods have arguably become more robust, and their primary use case is CLWE induction for pairs of resource-poor and distant languages. In this paper, we question the ability of even the most robust unsupervised CLWE approaches to induce meaningful CLWEs in these more challenging settings. A series of bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) experiments with 15 diverse languages (210 language pairs) show that fully unsupervised CLWE methods still fail for a large number of language pairs (e.g., they yield zero BLI performance for 87/210 pairs). Even when they succeed, they never surpass the performance of weakly supervised methods (seeded with 500-1,000 translation pairs) using the same self-learning procedure in any BLI setup, and the gaps are often substantial. These findings call for revisiting the main motivations behind fully unsupervised CLWE methods.\n\nHow are seed dictionaries obtained by fully unsupervised methods?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Fully unsupervised methods obtain seed dictionaries through an iterative self-learning procedure without any cross-lingual signal.", "row-id": 1860.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To dig a hole for a fire pit, follow these steps: \n1.

An Empirical Study of Granularity in Chinese-English NMT\nAbstract: Neural machine translation (NMT), a new approach to machine translation, has been proved to outperform conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) across a variety of language pairs. Translation is an open-vocabulary problem, but most existing NMT systems operate with a fixed vocabulary, which causes the incapability of translating rare words. This problem can be alleviated by using different translation granularities, such as character, subword and hybrid word-character. Translation involving Chinese is one of the most difficult tasks in machine translation, however, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any other work exploring which translation granularity is most suitable for Chinese in NMT. In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparison using Chinese-English NMT as a case study. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various translation granularities in detail. Our experiments show that subword model performs best for Chinese-to-English translation with the vocabulary which is not so big while hybrid word-character model is most suitable for English-to-Chinese translation. Moreover, experiments of different granularities show that Hybrid_BPE method can achieve best result on Chinese-to-English translation task.\n\nWhat is the worst performing translation granularity?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify the worst performing translation granularity.

Sources of hierarchical inductive bias in sequence-to-sequence networks\nAbstract: Learners that are exposed to the same training data might generalize differently due to differing inductive biases. In neural network models, inductive biases could in theory arise from any aspect of the model architecture. We investigate which architectural factors affect the generalization behavior of neural sequence-to-sequence models trained on two syntactic tasks, English question formation and English tense reinflection. For both tasks, the training set is consistent with a generalization based on hierarchical structure and a generalization based on linear order. All architectural factors that we investigated qualitatively affected how models generalized, including factors with no clear connection to hierarchical structure. For example, LSTMs and GRUs displayed qualitatively different inductive biases. However, the only factor that consistently contributed a hierarchical bias across tasks was the use of a tree-structured model rather than a model with sequential recurrence, suggesting that human-like syntactic generalization requires architectural syntactic structure.\n\nWhat architectural factors were investigated?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper investigated architectural factors such as the use of LSTMs, GRUs, and tree-structured models versus models with sequential recurrence.", "row-id": 2068.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 4.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 4.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The premise suggests that the man is in motion, which implies he is likely going somewhere.

Despite its recent success, NMT cannot handle a larger vocabulary because training complexity and decoding complexity proportionally increase with the number of target words. This problem becomes even more serious when translating patent documents, which contain many technical terms that are observed infrequently. In NMTs, words that are out of vocabulary are represented by a single unknown token. In this paper, we propose a method that enables NMT to translate patent sentences comprising a large vocabulary of technical terms. We train an NMT system on bilingual data wherein technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except technical terms. Further, we use it as a decoder to translate source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical term translations using SMT. We also use it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT score and that of the NMT rescoring of the translated sentences with technical term tokens. Our experiments on Japanese-Chinese patent sentences show that the proposed NMT system achieves a substantial improvement of up to 3.1 BLEU points and 2.3 RIBES points over traditional SMT systems and an improvement of approximately 0.6 BLEU points and 0.8 RIBES points over an equivalent NMT system without our proposed technique.\n\nCan the approach be generalized to other technical domains as well?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Yes, the approach can potentially be generalized to other technical domains.

We further introduce WPSLOR, a novel WordPiece-based version, which harnesses a more compact language model. Even though word-overlap metrics like ROUGE are computed with the help of hand-written references, our referenceless methods obtain a significantly higher correlation with human fluency scores on a benchmark dataset of compressed sentences. Finally, we present ROUGE-LM, a reference-based metric which is a natural extension of WPSLOR to the case of available references. We show that ROUGE-LM yields a significantly higher correlation with human judgments than all baseline metrics, including WPSLOR on its own.\n\nIs ROUGE their only baseline?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "No, ROUGE is not their only baseline.

These entities build up the topic of the summary. Moreover, they hold commonsense information once they are linked to a knowledge base. Based on these observations, this paper investigates the usage of linked entities to guide the decoder of a neural text summarizer to generate concise and better summaries. To this end, we leverage on an off-the-shelf entity linking system (ELS) to extract linked entities and propose Entity2Topic (E2T), a module easily attachable to a sequence-to-sequence model that transforms a list of entities into a vector representation of the topic of the summary. Current available ELS's are still not sufficiently effective, possibly introducing unresolved ambiguities and irrelevant entities. We resolve the imperfections of the ELS by (a) encoding entities with selective disambiguation, and (b) pooling entity vectors using firm attention. By applying E2T to a simple sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism as base model, we see significant improvements of the performance in the Gigaword (sentence to title) and CNN (long document to multi-sentence highlights) summarization datasets by at least 2 ROUGE points.\n\nWhy are current ELS's not sufficiently effective?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Current ELS's are not sufficiently effective because they can introduce unresolved ambiguities and irrelevant entities.", "row-id": 2164.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "An example of a learned behavior in a dog is when a dog sits on command after being trained to do so.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "Mercury_7213605"}, "prompt": "Which example describes a learned behavior in a dog?", "default_answer": "sitting on command", "model_answer": "An example of a learned behavior in a dog is when a dog sits on command after being trained to do so.", "row-id": 2169.0, "topic": "biology"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 4.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Yes, the MS Oasis of the Seas was built by STX Europe and it has a capacity of approximately 6,780 passengers.", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "khaimaitien/qa-expert-multi-hop-qa-V1.0", "meta_info": {"tag": "long_attributes-train.json", "src": "gen_qa"}, "prompt": "Is the MS Oasis of the Seas built by STX Europe and does it have a capacity of 6,780 passengers?", "default_answer": "Yes, the MS Oasis of the Seas was built by STX Europe and has a capacity of 6,780 passengers.

In this paper, we propose a simple method that reframes existing MRC datasets as interactive, partially observable environments. Specifically, we \"occlude\" the majority of a document's text and add context-sensitive commands that reveal \"glimpses\" of the hidden text to a model. We repurpose SQuAD and NewsQA as an initial case study, and then show how the interactive corpora can be used to train a model that seeks relevant information through sequential decision making.

Since documents are frequently associated with other related variables, such as labels or ratings, much interest has been placed on supervised topic models. However, the nature of most annotation tasks, prone to ambiguity and noise, often with high volumes of documents, deem learning under a single-annotator assumption unrealistic or unpractical for most real-world applications. In this article, we propose two supervised topic models, one for classification and another for regression problems, which account for the heterogeneity and biases among different annotators that are encountered in practice when learning from crowds. We develop an efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm that is able to scale to very large datasets, and we empirically demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nwhat are the advantages of the proposed model?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The proposed model accounts for the heterogeneity and biases among different annotators and is able to scale to very large datasets, providing advantages over state-of-the-art approaches.", "row-id": 2208.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To encourage your cat to use her litter box more, ensure the box is clean and placed in a quiet, accessible location.

As a result, accessing large collections of the former is much more difficult and time-consuming than the latter for humans. It's highly attractive to develop a machine which can automatically understand spoken content and summarize the key information for humans to browse over. In this endeavor, we propose a new task of machine comprehension of spoken content. We define the initial goal as the listening comprehension test of TOEFL, a challenging academic English examination for English learners whose native language is not English. We further propose an Attention-based Multi-hop Recurrent Neural Network (AMRNN) architecture for this task, achieving encouraging results in the initial tests. Initial results also have shown that word-level attention is probably more robust than sentence-level attention for this task with ASR errors.\n\nWhat is the new task proposed in this work?",

We propose an agent that sits between the user and a black box QA system and learns to reformulate questions to elicit the best possible answers. The agent probes the system with, potentially many, natural language reformulations of an initial question and aggregates the returned evidence to yield the best answer. The reformulation system is trained end-to-end to maximize answer quality using policy gradient. We evaluate on SearchQA, a dataset of complex questions extracted from Jeopardy!. The agent outperforms a state-of-the-art base model, playing the role of the environment, and other benchmarks. We also analyze the language that the agent has learned while interacting with the question answering system. We find that successful question reformulations look quite different from natural language paraphrases.

To encourage the progress on knowledge-based reasoning in MRC, we present knowledge-based MRC in this paper, and build a new dataset consisting of 40,047 question-answer pairs. The annotation of this dataset is designed so that successfully answering the questions requires understanding and the knowledge involved in a document. We implement a framework consisting of both a question answering model and a question generation model, both of which take the knowledge extracted from the document as well as relevant facts from an external knowledge base such as Freebase/ProBase/Reverb/NELL.

However, the uncertainty of associating target with source sentences makes UNMT theoretically an ill-posed problem. This work investigates the possibility of utilizing images for disambiguation to improve the performance of UNMT. Our assumption is intuitively based on the invariant property of image, i.e., the description of the same visual content by different languages should be approximately similar. We propose an unsupervised multi-modal machine translation (UMNMT) framework based on the language translation cycle consistency loss conditional on the image, targeting to learn the bidirectional multi-modal translation simultaneously. Through an alternate training between multi-modal and uni-modal, our inference model can translate with or without the image. On the widely used Multi30K dataset, the experimental results of our approach are significantly better than those of the text-only UNMT on the 2016 test dataset.\n\nWhy is this work different from text-only UNMT?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "This work is different from text-only UNMT because it utilizes images for disambiguation to improve translation performance.

The proposed system has two levels of attention to hierarchically build a meaningful representation. We evaluate our system on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2016 Task 6 and also compare it with the state-of-the-art systems on Stance Sentiment Emotion Corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed system improves the performance of sentiment analysis by 3.2 F-score points on SemEval 2016 Task 6 dataset.

I should stop writing and listen it!!! Is the review positive or negative?\n**Answer**\nPositive\n\n*Question*\nTitle: Not for me Review: I bought this book because I've enjoyed other Parker books, but not this one. I guess I just don't like mysteries about serial killers -- some psychotic stranger kills a bunch of people for some bizarre reason and has no other relationship with any of the other characters in the book -- this is just not interesting to me. Plus, the murders in serial killer books tend to be more gruesome than most -- ick! The writing was plodding too. We'd get one sentence about something happening and then 3 pages of boring background material. And I did not find one likable character in this book, even the \"hero.\" The book was tedious and depressing and after about 100 pages I skipped to the back to find out whodunnit and was glad I hadn't spent any more time on it. Is the review positive or negative?\n**Answer**\nNegative\n\n*Question*\nTitle: Not thrilled Review: This was so hyped in the media and I was so excited to get it. It really let me down. There wasn't the volume of music nor the quality of sound that was advertised. I love the artist but this left me flat. Is the review positive or negative?\n**Answer**\nNegative\n\n*Question*\nTitle: Authentic Swedish Recipes Review: The book jacket illustration is typical of older Scandinavian artwork. The recipes really were what I was looking for. I am a third generation Swede born in Canada. But my heritage is still alive with communication and visits back and forth with my Swedish relatives. I have eaten meals made just like the recipes read. I will be celebrating my heritage with real Swedish food that I can make.

However, when put in context, these translations may end up being inconsistent with each other. We propose a monolingual DocRepair model to correct inconsistencies between sentence-level translations. DocRepair performs automatic post-editing on a sequence of sentence-level translations, refining translations of sentences in context of each other. For training, the DocRepair model requires only monolingual document-level data in the target language. It is trained as a monolingual sequence-to-sequence model that maps inconsistent groups of sentences into consistent ones. The consistent groups come from the original training data; the inconsistent groups are obtained by sampling round-trip translations for each isolated sentence. We show that this approach successfully imitates inconsistencies we aim to fix: using contrastive evaluation, we show large improvements in the translation of several contextual phenomena in an English-Russian translation task, as well as improvements in the BLEU score. We also conduct a human evaluation and show a strong preference of the annotators to corrected translations over the baseline ones.

We achieve a score of 58.54% for Track-1 and 85.61% for Track-2. Our codebase is available publicly 1 .\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage has been the primary mode of communication for humans since the pre-historic ages. Studies have explored the evolution of language and outlined mathematical models that govern the intricacies of natural language . Inevitably, as humans established civilization in various parts of the world, this language was modified by, and for the group of people occupied by that particular geographical region.\nThis gave rise to multiple national dialects of the same language. The VarDial workshop (colocated with EACL 2023) explores various dialects and variations of the same language. We participated in the Discriminating Between Similar Languages -True Labels (DSL-TL) shared task. In this task, the participants were provided with data from three languages, with each language having three varieties.\nThis shared task consisted of two tracks -Track-1 featuring nine-way classification and Track-2 featuring six-way classification. The second track included two particular national dialects of each language (eg. American English and British English), and the first track had one general  We ranked 1 st in both of the tracks.\nMoreover, we beat the next best submission by a margin of 4.5% in the first task and 5.6% in the second task.We were the only team to surpass the organizer baseline scores. We present our winning solution in this paper. We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language.\nWe converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research.\n\nRelated Work\n\nThe present literature encompasses various aspects of dialect identification. We study this from three perspectives: large language models, language identification and dialect classification problems.\n\nLarge Language Models\n\nThe success of transformers and BERT based models was inevitable since the initial boom of the transformer  2017) model.

Previous supervised summarization systems often perform the two tasks in isolation. However, since reference summaries are the trade-off between relevance and saliency, using them as supervision, neither of the two rankers could be trained well. This paper proposes a novel summarization system called AttSum, which tackles the two tasks jointly. It automatically learns distributed representations for sentences as well as the document cluster. Meanwhile, it applies the attention mechanism to simulate the attentive reading of human behavior when a query is given. Extensive experiments are conducted on DUC query-focused summarization benchmark datasets. Without using any hand-crafted features, AttSum achieves competitive performance. We also observe that the sentences recognized to focus on the query indeed meet the query need.\n\nWhat models do they compare to?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify which models AttSum is compared to.

SimplerVoice can automatically generate sensible sentences describing an unknown object, extract semantic meanings of the object usage in the form of a query string, then, represent the string as multiple types of visual guidance (pictures, pictographs, etc.). We demonstrate SimplerVoice system in a case study of generating grocery products' manuals through a mobile application. To evaluate, we conducted a user study on SimplerVoice's generated description in comparison to the information interpreted by users from other methods: the original product package and search engines' top result, in which SimplerVoice achieved the highest performance score: 4.82 on 5-point mean opinion score scale. Our result shows that SimplerVoice is able to provide low-literate end-users with simple yet informative components to help them understand how to use the grocery products, and that the system may potentially provide benefits in other real-world use cases\n\nDoes their solution involve connecting images and text?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Yes, their solution involves connecting images and text.

Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO), however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity. Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity, and diet and obesity DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with Diabetes, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for Diet included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for Exercise included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for Obesity included Alzheimer, cancer, and children. With 2.67 billion social media users in 2016, publicly available data such as Twitter posts can be utilized to support clinical providers, public health experts, and social scientists in better understanding common public opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity.\n\nHow were topics of interest about DDEO identified?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The topics of interest about DDEO were identified using a multi-component semantic and linguistic framework developed to collect Twitter data and analyze the topics.", "row-id": 2578.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To catch dust from drilling, you can use a dust collector attachment on the drill, hold a vacuum nozzle near the drilling site, or tape a folded piece of paper or plastic below the drill hole to catch falling dust.", "tag": "physical_reasoning", "source": "ybisk/piqa", "meta_info": null, "prompt": "Catch dust from drilling.", "default_answer": "Bend a post it note under hole.", "model_answer": "To catch dust from drilling, you can use a dust collector attachment on the drill, hold a vacuum nozzle near the drilling site, or tape a folded piece of paper or plastic below the drill hole to catch falling dust.", "row-id": 2579.0, "topic": "engineering"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The paper mentions the use of classification approaches without reinforcement learning for the 2019 BioASQ challenge.", "tag": "context_based", "source": "allenai/qasper", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "1909.00542"}, "prompt": "You are given a paper:\nTitle: Classification Betters Regression in Query-based Multi-document Summarisation Techniques for Question Answering: Macquarie University at BioASQ7b\nAbstract: Task B Phase B of the 2019 BioASQ challenge focuses on biomedical question answering.

For a wide range of applications, vertices in a network are typically accompanied by rich textual information such as user profiles, paper abstracts, etc. We propose to incorporate semantic features into network embeddings by matching important words between text sequences for all pairs of vertices. We introduce a word-by-word alignment framework that measures the compatibility of embeddings between word pairs, and then adaptively accumulates these alignment features with a simple yet effective aggregation function. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed framework on three real-world benchmarks for downstream tasks, including link prediction and multi-label vertex classification.

As gender bias has been highlighted in numerous natural language processing (NLP) applications, we study the impact of the gender imbalance in TV and radio broadcast on the performance of an ASR system. This analysis shows that women are under-represented in our data in terms of speakers and speech turns. We introduce the notion of speaker role to refine our analysis and find that women are even fewer within the Anchor category corresponding to prominent speakers. The disparity of available data for both gender causes performance to decrease on women.

Our novel neural approaches demonstrate 24.6% error reduction in hashtag segmentation accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art method.

Previous work in morphological tagging improves performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) through cross-lingual training with a high-resource language (HRL) from the same family, but is limited by the strict, often false, assumption that tag sets exactly overlap between the HRL and LRL. In this paper we propose a method for cross-lingual morphological tagging that aims to improve information sharing between languages by relaxing this assumption. The proposed model uses factorial conditional random fields with neural network potentials, making it possible to (1) utilize the expressive power of neural network representations to smooth over superficial differences in the surface forms, (2) model pairwise and transitive relationships between tags, and (3) accurately generate tag sets that are unseen or rare in the training data.

In our paper, we propose to evaluate natural language generation models by learning to compare a pair of generated sentences by fine-tuning BERT, which has been shown to have good natural language understanding ability. We also propose to evaluate the model-level quality of NLG models with sample-level comparison results with skill rating system. While able to be trained in a fully self-supervised fashion, our model can be further fine-tuned with a little amount of human preference annotation to better imitate human judgment. In addition to evaluating trained models, we propose to apply our model as a performance indicator during training for better hyperparameter tuning and early-stopping. We evaluate our approach on both story generation and chit-chat dialogue response generation. Experimental results show that our model correlates better with human preference compared with previous automated evaluation approaches. Training with the proposed metric yields better performance in human evaluation, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n\nWhat previous automated evalution approaches authors mention?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The authors mention BLEU and Perplexity as previous automated evaluation approaches.", "row-id": 2714.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To make a local water sprinkler for kids, you can use a plastic bottle and a garden hose.

Though there are abundant datasets annotated with event relations for story comprehension, many have no empirical results associated with them. In this work, we establish strong baselines for event temporal relation extraction on two under-explored story narrative datasets: Richer Event Description (RED) and Causal and Temporal Relation Scheme (CaTeRS). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results reported on these two datasets. We demonstrate that neural network-based models can outperform some strong traditional linguistic feature-based models.

Existing machine learning techniques for citation sentiment analysis are focusing on labor-intensive feature engineering, which requires large annotated corpus. As an automatic feature extraction tool, word2vec has been successfully applied to sentiment analysis of short texts. In this work, I conducted empirical research with the question: how well does word2vec work on the sentiment analysis of citations? The proposed method constructed sentence vectors (sent2vec) by averaging the word embeddings, which were learned from Anthology Collections (ACL-Embeddings). I also investigated polarity-specific word embeddings (PS-Embeddings) for classifying positive and negative citations. The sentence vectors formed a feature space, to which the examined citation sentence was mapped to. Those features were input into classifiers (support vector machines) for supervised classification. Using 10-cross-validation scheme, evaluation was conducted on a set of annotated citations. The results showed that word embeddings are effective on classifying positive and negative citations.

I will just say that Marty is just as fond of the cafeteria as he claims I am.\nSolution:", "default_answer": "Non-identity-attack", "model_answer": "Non-identity-attack\nExplanation: The comment criticizes Marty for being a hypocrite but does not attack any aspect of his identity such as race, gender, or appearance.", "row-id": 2769.0, "topic": "life_advice"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 1.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Voici quelques citations inspirantes :\n1. \"Le succ\u00e8s n'est pas la cl\u00e9 du bonheur.

The science community has been working very actively to understand this new disease and make diagnosis and treatment guidelines based on the findings. One major stream of efforts are focused on discovering the correlation between radiological findings in the lung areas and COVID-19. There have been several works BIBREF0, BIBREF1 publishing such results. However, existing studies are mostly conducted separately by different hospitals and medical institutes. Due to geographic affinity, the populations served by different hospitals have different genetic, social, and ethnic characteristics. As a result, the radiological findings from COVID-19 patient cases in different populations are different. This population bias incurs inconsistent or even conflicting conclusions regarding the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. As a result, medical professionals cannot make informed decisions on how to use radiological findings to guide diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.\nWe aim to address this issue. Our research goal is to develop natural language processing methods to collectively analyze the study results reported by many hospitals and medical institutes all over the world, reconcile these results, and make a holistic and unbiased conclusion regarding the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19. Specifically, we take the CORD-19 dataset BIBREF2, which contains over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. We develop sentence classification methods to identify all sentences narrating radiological findings from COVID-19. Then constituent parsing is utilized to identify all noun phrases from these sentences and these noun phrases contain abnormalities, lesions, diseases identified by radiology imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT). We calculate the frequency of these noun phrases and select those with top frequencies for medical professionals to further investigate. Since these clinical entities are aggregated from a number of hospitals all over the world, the population bias is largely mitigated and the conclusions are more objective and universally informative. From the CORD-19 dataset, our method successfully discovers a set of clinical findings that are closely related with COVID-19.\nThe major contributions of this paper include:\nWe develop natural language processing methods to perform unbiased study of the correlation between radiological findings and COVID-19.\nWe develop a bootstrapping approach to effectively train a sentence classifier with light-weight manual annotation effort. The sentence classifier is used to extract radiological findings from a vast amount of literature.\nWe conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. From the CORD-19 dataset, our method successfully discovers a set of clinical findings that are closely related with COVID-19.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the data. Section 3 presents the method. Section 4 gives experimental results. Section 5 concludes the paper.\nDataset\nWe used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) BIBREF2 for our study. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of research groups prepared the CORD-19 dataset. It contains over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. These articles are contributed by hospitals and medical institutes all over the world. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 is after November 2019, we select articles published after November 2019 to study, which include a total of 2081 articles and about 360000 sentences.

These comments were labeled as racist or non-racist by multiple annotators. For our approach, three discourse dictionaries were created: first, we created a dictionary by retrieving possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \\texttt{word2vec} model trained on a large corpus of general Dutch text. Finally, a third dictionary was created by manually filtering out incorrect expansions. We trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over the different categories in the dictionaries as features. The best-performing model used the manually cleaned dictionary and obtained an F-score of 0.46 for the racist class on a test set consisting of unseen Dutch comments, retrieved from the same sites used for the training set. The automated expansion of the dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of the expanded dictionaries did increase indicates that the words that were automatically added did occur in the corpus, but were not able to meaningfully impact performance.

Devising Controlled Probes using Expert Knowledge\nAbstract: Open-domain question answering (QA) is known to involve several underlying knowledge and reasoning challenges, but are models actually learning such knowledge when trained on benchmark tasks? To investigate this, we introduce several new challenge tasks that probe whether state-of-the-art QA models have general knowledge about word definitions and general taxonomic reasoning, both of which are fundamental to more complex forms of reasoning and are widespread in benchmark datasets. As an alternative to expensive crowd-sourcing, we introduce a methodology for automatically building datasets from various types of expert knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs and lexical taxonomies), allowing for systematic control over the resulting probes and for a more comprehensive evaluation. We find automatically constructing probes to be vulnerable to annotation artifacts, which we carefully control for. Our evaluation confirms that transformer-based QA models are already predisposed to recognize certain types of structural lexical knowledge. However, it also reveals a more nuanced picture: their performance degrades substantially with even a slight increase in the number of hops in the underlying taxonomic hierarchy, or as more challenging distractor candidate answers are introduced. Further, even when these models succeed at the standard instance-level evaluation, they leave much room for improvement when assessed at the level of clusters of semantically connected probes (e.g., all Isa questions about a concept).\n\nAre the automatically constructed datasets subject to quality control?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Yes, the automatically constructed datasets are subject to quality control, as the paper mentions that they carefully control for annotation artifacts.", "row-id": 2902.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The results indicate that the proposed method effectively learns affective events without manually labeled data and improves supervised learning results when labeled data are small.", "tag": "context_based", "source": "allenai/qasper", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "1909.00694"}, "prompt": "You are given a paper:\nTitle: Minimally Supervised Learning of Affective Events Using Discourse Relations\nAbstract: Recognizing affective events that trigger positive or negative sentiment has a wide range of natural language processing applications but remains a challenging problem mainly because the polarity of an event is not necessarily predictable from its constituent words.

However, time-critical analysis of big crisis data on social media streams brings challenges to machine learning techniques, especially the ones that use supervised learning. The Scarcity of labeled data, particularly in the early hours of a crisis, delays the machine learning process. The current state-of-the-art classification methods require a significant amount of labeled data specific to a particular event for training plus a lot of feature engineering to achieve best results. In this work, we introduce neural network based classification methods for binary and multi-class tweet classification task. We show that neural network based models do not require any feature engineering and perform better than state-of-the-art methods. In the early hours of a disaster when no labeled data is available, our proposed method makes the best use of the out-of-event data and achieves good results.\n\nwhat was their baseline comparison?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper compares their neural network-based classification methods with state-of-the-art classification methods that require a significant amount of labeled data and feature engineering.", "row-id": 2926.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "The paper's abstract does not provide a specific explanation for the effectiveness of back-translation, only stating that their findings confirm its effectiveness and offer new explanations.

A major difference with the previous generation (Phrase-Based MT) is the way monolingual target data, which often abounds, is used in these two paradigms. While Phrase-Based MT can seamlessly integrate very large language models trained on billions of sentences, the best option for Neural MT developers seems to be the generation of artificial parallel data through \\textsl{back-translation} - a technique that fails to fully take advantage of existing datasets. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of back-translation, comparing alternative uses of monolingual data, as well as multiple data generation procedures. Our findings confirm that back-translation is very effective and give new explanations as to why this is the case. We also introduce new data simulation techniques that are almost as effective, yet much cheaper to implement.\n\nwhat is their explanation for the effectiveness of back-translation?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper's abstract does not provide a specific explanation for the effectiveness of back-translation, only stating that their findings confirm its effectiveness and offer new explanations.

The growing interest in personal digital assistants, such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana, demonstrates the willingness of users to employ conversational interactions BIBREF0. As a result, conversational information seeking (CIS) has been recognized as a major emerging research area in the Third Strategic Workshop on Information Retrieval (SWIRL 2018) BIBREF1.\nResearch progress in CIS relies on the availability of resources to the community. There have been recent efforts on providing data for various CIS tasks, such as the TREC 2019 Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT), MISC BIBREF2, Qulac BIBREF3, CoQA BIBREF4, QuAC BIBREF5, SCS BIBREF6, and CCPE-M BIBREF7. In addition, BIBREF8 have implemented a demonstration for conversational movie recommendation based on Google's DialogFlow. Despite all of these resources, the community still feels the lack of a suitable platform for developing CIS systems. We believe that providing such platform will speed up the progress in conversational information seeking research. Therefore, we developed a general framework for supporting CIS research. The framework is called Macaw. This paper describes the high-level architecture of Macaw, the supported functionality, and our future vision. Researchers working on various CIS tasks should be able to take advantage of Macaw in their projects.\nMacaw is designed based on a modular architecture to support different information seeking tasks, including conversational search, conversational question answering, conversational recommendation, and conversational natural language interface to structured and semi-structured data. Each interaction in Macaw (from both user and system) is a Message object, thus a conversation is a list of Messages. Macaw consists of multiple actions, each action is a module that can satisfy the information needs of users for some requests. For example, search and question answering can be two actions in Macaw. Even multiple search algorithms can be also seen as multiple actions. Each action can produce multiple outputs (e.g., multiple retrieved documents). For every user interaction, Macaw runs all actions in parallel. The actions' outputs produced within a predefined time interval (i.e., an interaction timeout constant) are then post-processed. Macaw can choose one or combine multiple of these outputs and prepare an output Message object as the user's response.\nThe modular design of Macaw makes it relatively easy to configure a different user interface or add a new one. The current implementation of Macaw supports a command line interface as well as mobile, desktop, and web apps. In more detail, Macaw's interface can be a Telegram bot, which supports a wide range of devices and operating systems (see FIGREF4). This allows Macaw to support multi-modal interactions, such as text, speech, image, click, etc. A number of APIs for automatic speech recognition and generation have been employed to support speech interactions. Note that the Macaw's architecture and implementation allows mixed-initiative interactions.\nThe research community can benefit from Macaw for the following purposes:\n[leftmargin=*]\nDeveloping algorithms, tools, and techniques for CIS.\nStudying user interactions with CIS systems.\nPerforming CIS studies based on an intermediary person and wizard of oz.\nPreparing quick demonstration for a developed CIS model.\nMacaw Architecture\nMacaw has a modular design, with the goal of making it easy to configure and add new modules such as a different user interface or different retrieval module. The overall setup also follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) like architecture.

In earlier research, image synthesis relied mainly on word to image correlation analysis combined with supervised methods to find best alignment of the visual content matching to the text. Recent progress in deep learning (DL) has brought a new set of unsupervised deep learning methods, particularly deep generative models which are able to generate realistic visual images using suitably trained neural network models. In this paper, we review the most recent development in the text-to-image synthesis research domain. Our survey first introduces image synthesis and its challenges, and then reviews key concepts such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and deep convolutional encoder-decoder neural networks (DCNN). After that, we propose a taxonomy to summarize GAN based text-to-image synthesis into four major categories: Semantic Enhancement GANs, Resolution Enhancement GANs, Diversity Enhancement GANS, and Motion Enhancement GANs. We elaborate the main objective of each group, and further review typical GAN architectures in each group. The taxonomy and the review outline the techniques and the evolution of different approaches, and eventually provide a clear roadmap to summarize the list of contemporaneous solutions that utilize GANs and DCNNs to generate enthralling results in categories such as human faces, birds, flowers, room interiors, object reconstruction from edge maps (games) etc. The survey will conclude with a comparison of the proposed solutions, challenges that remain unresolved, and future developments in the text-to-image synthesis domain.\n\nIs text-to-image synthesis trained is suppervized or unsuppervized manner?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Text-to-image synthesis can be trained in both supervised and unsupervised manners.

However, modeling contexts in very high dimensional space can lead to poor generalizability. We introduce the Pyramidal Recurrent Unit (PRU), which enables learning representations in high dimensional space with more generalization power and fewer parameters. PRUs replace the linear transformation in LSTMs with more sophisticated interactions including pyramidal and grouped linear transformations. This architecture gives strong results on word-level language modeling while reducing the number of parameters significantly. In particular, PRU improves the perplexity of a recent state-of-the-art language model Merity et al. (2018) by up to 1.3 points while learning 15-20% fewer parameters. For similar number of model parameters, PRU outperforms all previous RNN models that exploit different gating mechanisms and transformations. We provide a detailed examination of the PRU and its behavior on the language modeling tasks.

For both models, we demonstrate the effect of different architectural choices. We present a new context representation for convolutional neural networks for relation classification (extended middle context). Furthermore, we propose connectionist bi-directional recurrent neural networks and introduce ranking loss for their optimization. Finally, we show that combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks using a simple voting scheme is accurate enough to improve results.

Interestingly, while multilingual BERT models have demonstrated impressive results, recent works have shown how monolingual BERT can also be competitive in zero-shot cross-lingual settings. This suggests that the abstractions learned by these models can transfer across languages, even when trained on monolingual data. In this paper, we investigate whether such generalization potential applies to other modalities, such as vision: does BERT contain abstractions that generalize beyond text? We introduce BERT-gen, an architecture for text generation based on BERT, able to leverage on either mono- or multi- modal representations. The results reported under different configurations indicate a positive answer to our research question, and the proposed model obtains substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art on two established Visual Question Generation datasets.\n\nWhat is different in BERT-gen from standard BERT?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "BERT-gen is different from standard BERT in that it is an architecture for text generation based on BERT, capable of leveraging either mono- or multi-modal representations, whereas standard BERT is primarily focused on text-based tasks.", "row-id": 3047.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Planting legumes in order to add nitrogen to soil most likely causes an increase in soil fertility.

We study how the word usage of U.S. Congressional speeches varies across states and party affiliation, how words are used differently across sections of the ArXiv, and how the co-purchase patterns of groceries can vary across seasons. Key to the success of our method is that the groups share statistical information. We develop two sharing strategies: hierarchical modeling and amortization. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in empirical studies of speeches, abstracts, and shopping baskets.

Context accompanying a hate speech text is useful for identifying hate speech, which however has been largely overlooked in existing datasets and hate speech detection models. In this paper, we provide an annotated corpus of hate speech with context information well kept. Then we propose two types of hate speech detection models that incorporate context information, a logistic regression model with context features and a neural network model with learning components for context. Our evaluation shows that both models outperform a strong baseline by around 3% to 4% in F1 score and combining these two models further improve the performance by another 7% in F1 score.\n\nWhat context do they use?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper uses context accompanying hate speech text, but the specific types of context are not detailed in the abstract.", "row-id": 3150.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Radio signal interruption can cause a humming or buzzing sound due to electromagnetic interference or signal distortion.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "Mercury_7098140"}, "prompt": "Radio signal interruption sometimes causes a humming or buzzing sound.

Undoubtedly, neural language models (NLMs) have reduced perplexity by impressive amounts. This progress, however, comes at a substantial cost in performance, in terms of inference latency and energy consumption, which is particularly of concern in deployments on mobile devices. This paper, which examines the quality-performance tradeoff of various language modeling techniques, represents to our knowledge the first to make this observation. We compare state-of-the-art NLMs with\"classic\"Kneser-Ney (KN) LMs in terms of energy usage, latency, perplexity, and prediction accuracy using two standard benchmarks. On a Raspberry Pi, we find that orders of increase in latency and energy usage correspond to less change in perplexity, while the difference is much less pronounced on a desktop.\n\nwhat classic language models are mentioned in the paper?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The classic language model mentioned in the paper is the Kneser-Ney (KN) language model.", "row-id": 3252.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Chittagong Public Library is located in Bangladesh, which is considered a developing country.

However, existing transfer methods involving a common target language are far from success in the extreme scenario of zero-shot translation, due to the language space mismatch problem between transferor (the parent model) and transferee (the child model) on the source side. To address this challenge, we propose an effective transfer learning approach based on cross-lingual pre-training. Our key idea is to make all source languages share the same feature space and thus enable a smooth transition for zero-shot translation. To this end, we introduce one monolingual pre-training method and two bilingual pre-training methods to obtain a universal encoder for different languages. Once the universal encoder is constructed, the parent model built on such encoder is trained with large-scale annotated data and then directly applied in zero-shot translation scenario. Experiments on two public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms strong pivot-based baseline and various multilingual NMT approaches.\n\nwhich multilingual approaches do they compare with?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper compares their approach with a pivot-based baseline and various multilingual NMT approaches (specific approaches not named in the abstract).", "row-id": 3266.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "As of the latest available data, New South Wales has a significantly larger population compared to Western Australia.

Our current understanding of this interplay is mostly limited to glimpses gathered from isolated studies of individual communities. In this work we provide a systematic exploration of the nature of this relation across a wide variety of online communities. To this end we introduce a quantitative, language-based typology reflecting two key aspects of a community's identity: how distinctive, and how temporally dynamic it is. By mapping almost 300 Reddit communities into the landscape induced by this typology, we reveal regularities in how patterns of user engagement vary with the characteristics of a community. Our results suggest that the way new and existing users engage with a community depends strongly and systematically on the nature of the collective identity it fosters, in ways that are highly consequential to community maintainers. For example, communities with distinctive and highly dynamic identities are more likely to retain their users. However, such niche communities also exhibit much larger acculturation gaps between existing users and newcomers, which potentially hinder the integration of the latter. More generally, our methodology reveals differences in how various social phenomena manifest across communities, and shows that structuring the multi-community landscape can lead to a better understanding of the systematic nature of this diversity.\n\nWhat patterns do they observe about how user engagement varies with the characteristics of a community?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper observes that communities with distinctive and highly dynamic identities are more likely to retain their users.

Torch-Struct includes a broad collection of probabilistic structures accessed through a simple and flexible distribution-based API that connects to any deep learning model. The library utilizes batched, vectorized operations and exploits auto-differentiation to produce readable, fast, and testable code. Internally, we also include a number of general-purpose optimizations to provide cross-algorithm efficiency. Experiments show significant performance gains over fast baselines and case-studies demonstrate the benefits of the library.

Numerous sentiment classification techniques, including conventional and deep learning-based methods, have been proposed in the literature. In most existing methods, a high-quality training set is assumed to be given. Nevertheless, constructing a high-quality training set that consists of highly accurate labels is challenging in real applications. This difficulty stems from the fact that text samples usually contain complex sentiment representations, and their annotation is subjective. We address this challenge in this study by leveraging a new labeling strategy and utilizing a two-level long short-term memory network to construct a sentiment classifier. Lexical cues are useful for sentiment analysis, and they have been utilized in conventional studies. For example, polar and privative words play important roles in sentiment analysis. A new encoding strategy, that is, $\\rho$-hot encoding, is proposed to alleviate the drawbacks of one-hot encoding and thus effectively incorporate useful lexical cues.

Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.\n\nAccording to the authors, why does the CNN model exhibit a higher level of explainability?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "According to the authors, the CNN model exhibits a higher level of explainability because it allows for the decomposition of predictions onto individual words using the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method, which provides a clearer understanding of how much each word contributes to the classification decision.", "row-id": 3394.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The distance between Richmond and Norfolk is best measured in miles or kilometers.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "VASoL_2010_5_39"}, "prompt": "The distance between Richmond and Norfolk is best measured in ___.", "default_answer": "kilometers", "model_answer": "The distance between Richmond and Norfolk is best measured in miles or kilometers.", "row-id": 3397.0, "topic": "math"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The regional office of the World Bank in India is located in New Delhi.", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "khaimaitien/qa-expert-multi-hop-qa-V1.0", "meta_info": {"tag": "musique-single_valid.json", "src": "musique"}, "prompt": "The regional office of the World Bank in India is located in what city?", "default_answer": "Based on the provided knowledge, the regional office of the World Bank in India is located in New Delhi.", "model_answer": "The regional office of the World Bank in India is located in New Delhi.", "row-id": 3398.0, "topic": "economy"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To prepare red bell pepper and spinach for goat cheese white sauce pasta, first wash and slice the red bell pepper into thin strips.

We focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), state of the art models in speech recognition and translation. Our approach to increasing interpretability is by combining an RNN with a hidden Markov model (HMM), a simpler and more transparent model. We explore various combinations of RNNs and HMMs: an HMM trained on LSTM states; a hybrid model where an HMM is trained first, then a small LSTM is given HMM state distributions and trained to fill in gaps in the HMM's performance; and a jointly trained hybrid model. We find that the LSTM and HMM learn complementary information about the features in the text.\n\nWhich methods do the authors use to reach the conclusion that LSTMs and HMMs learn complementary information?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The authors use various combinations of RNNs and HMMs, including an HMM trained on LSTM states, a hybrid model where an HMM is trained first and then a small LSTM is trained on HMM state distributions, and a jointly trained hybrid model to conclude that LSTMs and HMMs learn complementary information.", "row-id": 3426.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "As of the latest available data, Mike Adenuga's net worth is estimated to be around $6 billion.

Seq2seq VC models are attractive owing to their ability to convert prosody. While seq2seq models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to VC, the use of the Transformer network, which has shown promising results in various speech processing tasks, has not yet been investigated. Nonetheless, their data-hungry property and the mispronunciation of converted speech make seq2seq models far from practical. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective pretraining technique to transfer knowledge from learned TTS models, which benefit from large-scale, easily accessible TTS corpora. VC models initialized with such pretrained model parameters are able to generate effective hidden representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech. Experimental results show that such a pretraining scheme can facilitate data-efficient training and outperform an RNN-based seq2seq VC model in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, and similarity.\n\nWhat is the baseline model?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The baseline model is an RNN-based seq2seq VC model.", "row-id": 3474.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The property of water that can cause a rock to break apart is its ability to expand when it freezes.

To test this, we trained versions of contextualised word embedding ELMo models on raw tokenized corpora and on the corpora with word tokens replaced by their lemmas. Then, these models were evaluated on the word sense disambiguation task. This was done for the English and Russian languages.  ::: The experiments showed that while lemmatization is indeed not necessary for English, the situation is different for Russian. It seems that for rich-morphology languages, using lemmatized training and testing data yields small but consistent improvements: at least for word sense disambiguation. This means that the decisions about text pre-processing before training ELMo should consider the linguistic nature of the language in question.\n\nWhy is lemmatization not necessary in English?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Lemmatization is not necessary in English because the language has a relatively simple morphology compared to languages like Russian.

The Case of Yor\\`ub\\'a and Twi\nAbstract: The success of several architectures to learn semantic representations from unannotated text and the availability of these kind of texts in online multilingual resources such as Wikipedia has facilitated the massive and automatic creation of resources for multiple languages. The evaluation of such resources is usually done for the high-resourced languages, where one has a smorgasbord of tasks and test sets to evaluate on. For low-resourced languages, the evaluation is more difficult and normally ignored, with the hope that the impressive capability of deep learning architectures to learn (multilingual) representations in the high-resourced setting holds in the low-resourced setting too. In this paper we focus on two African languages, Yor\\`ub\\'a and Twi, and compare the word embeddings obtained in this way, with word embeddings obtained from curated corpora and a language-dependent processing. We analyse the noise in the publicly available corpora, collect high quality and noisy data for the two languages and quantify the improvements that depend not only on the amount of data but on the quality too. We also use different architectures that learn word representations both from surface forms and characters to further exploit all the available information which showed to be important for these languages. For the evaluation, we manually translate the wordsim-353 word pairs dataset from English into Yor\\`ub\\'a and Twi. As output of the work, we provide corpora, embeddings and the test suits for both languages.\n\nWhat turn out to be more important high volume or high quality data?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper suggests that both the amount of data and the quality are important, but emphasizes that improvements depend not only on the amount of data but also on the quality.

Experimental analysis on multiple datasets demonstrates that our proposed system performs remarkably well on all cases while outperforming the previously reported state of the art by a margin.

For a bag-of-words representation, each view focuses on a different subset of the text's words. Aggregating many such views results in a more discriminative and robust representation. Through a novel architecture that both stacks and concatenates views, we produce a network that emphasizes both depth and width, allowing training to converge quickly.

Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.\n\nAre the document vectors that the authors introduce evaluated in any way other than the new way the authors propose?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not provide information on whether the document vectors are evaluated in any way other than the new method proposed by the authors.", "row-id": 3675.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Planets remain in orbit around the Sun because of the gravitational force between the Sun and the planets, which provides the necessary centripetal force to keep them in orbit.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "Mercury_402066"}, "prompt": "Planets remain in orbit around the Sun because of", "default_answer": "gravity.", "model_answer": "Planets remain in orbit around the Sun because of the gravitational force between the Sun and the planets, which provides the necessary centripetal force to keep them in orbit.", "row-id": 3676.0, "topic": "physics"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To make blue ice cubes, you can add a few drops of blue food coloring to water before freezing it in an ice cube tray.", "tag": "physical_reasoning", "source": "ybisk/piqa", "meta_info": null, "prompt": "How to make blue ice cubes", "default_answer": "To make blue ice cubes, mix a hefty amount of blue food coloring to water in an ice cube tray and freeze.", "model_answer": "To make blue ice cubes, you can add a few drops of blue food coloring to water before freezing it in an ice cube tray.", "row-id": 3680.0, "topic": "cooking"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica is located in Panama.

We introduce a pair-to-sequence model for unanswerable question generation, which effectively captures the interactions between the question and the paragraph. We also present a way to construct training data for our question generation models by leveraging the existing reading comprehension dataset. Experimental results show that the pair-to-sequence model performs consistently better compared with the sequence-to-sequence baseline.

Labeling thousands of hours of audio, however, is expensive and time-consuming. A natural question to ask is how to achieve better generalization with fewer training examples. Active learning studies this problem by identifying and labeling only the most informative data, potentially reducing sample complexity. How much active learning can help in large-scale, end-to-end ASR systems, however, is still an open question.\nThe speech recognition community has generally identified the informativeness of samples by calculating confidence scores. In particular, an utterance is considered informative if the most likely prediction has small probability BIBREF1 , or if the predictions are distributed very uniformly over the labels BIBREF2 . Though confidence-based measures work well in practice, less attention has been focused on gradient-based methods like Expected Gradient Length (EGL) BIBREF3 , where the informativeness is measured by the norm of the gradient incurred by the instance. EGL has previously been justified as intuitively measuring the expected change in a model's parameters BIBREF3 .We formalize this intuition from the perspective of asymptotic variance reduction, and experimentally, we show EGL to be superior to confidence-based methods on speech recognition tasks. Additionally, we observe that the ranking of samples scored by EGL is not correlated with that of confidence scoring, suggesting EGL identifies aspects of an instance that confidence scores cannot capture.\nIn BIBREF3 , EGL was applied to active learning on sequence labeling tasks, but our work is the first we know of to apply EGL to speech recognition in particular. Gradient-based methods have also found applications outside active learning. For example, BIBREF4 suggests that in stochastic gradient descent, sampling training instances with probabilities proportional to their gradient lengths can speed up convergence. From the perspective of variance reduction, this importance sampling problem shares many similarities to problems found in active learning.\nProblem Formulation\nDenote INLINEFORM0 as an utterance and INLINEFORM1 the corresponding label (transcription). A speech recognition system models the conditional distribution INLINEFORM2 , where INLINEFORM3 are the parameters in the model, and INLINEFORM4 is typically implemented by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A training set is a collection of INLINEFORM5 pairs, denoted as INLINEFORM6 . The parameters of the model are estimated by minimizing the negative log-likelihood on the training set: DISPLAYFORM0\nActive learning seeks to augment the training set with a new set of utterances and labels INLINEFORM0 in order to achieve good generalization on a held-out test dataset. In many applications, there is an unlabeled pool INLINEFORM1 which is costly to label in its entirety. INLINEFORM2 is queried for the \u201cmost informative\u201d instance(s) INLINEFORM3 , for which the label(s) INLINEFORM4 are then obtained. We discuss several such query strategies below.\nConfidence Scores\nConfidence scoring has been used extensively as a proxy for the informativeness of training samples. Specifically, an INLINEFORM0 is considered informative if the predictions are uniformly distributed over all the labels BIBREF2 , or if the best prediction of its label is with low probability BIBREF1 . By taking the instances which \u201cconfuse\u201d the model, these methods may effectively explore under-sampled regions of the input space.\nExpected Gradient Length\nIntuitively, an instance can be considered informative if it results in large changes in model parameters.

For the 2017 Multi-Genre Broadcast challenge (MGB-3) there were two possible tasks: Arabic speech recognition, and Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In this paper, we describe our efforts to create an ADI system for the MGB-3 challenge, with the goal of distinguishing amongst four major Arabic dialects, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Our research fo- cused on dialect variability and domain mismatches between the training and test domain. In order to achieve a robust ADI system, we explored both Siamese neural network models to learn similarity and dissimilarities among Arabic dialects, as well as i-vector post-processing to adapt domain mismatches. Both Acoustic and linguistic features were used for the final MGB-3 submissions, with the best primary system achieving 75% accuracy on the official 10hr test set.\n\nHow do they explore dialect variability?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "They explore dialect variability using Siamese neural network models to learn similarities and dissimilarities among Arabic dialects.", "row-id": 3734.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u6b3e\u79d1\u5e7b\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5c04\u51fb\u6e38\u620f\uff1a\n1. \u300a\u547d\u8fd02\u300b\n2. \u300a\u5149\u73af\uff1a\u65e0\u9650\u300b\n3. \u300a\u6cf0\u5766\u9668\u843d2\u300b\n4. \u300a\u8d28\u91cf\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u4ed9\u5973\u5ea7\u300b\n5. \u300a\u6bc1\u706d\u6218\u58eb\uff1a\u6c38\u6052\u300b", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "oasst1_1907", "original_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/oasst1_converted", "question_length": 33}, "prompt": "\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u73a9\u79d1\u5e7b\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5c04\u51fb\uff08FPS\uff09\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u6211\u63a8\u8350\u51e0\u6b3e\u5417\uff1f", "default_answer": "\u79d1\u5e7b\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5c04\u51fb\uff08FPS\uff09\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u300a\u5b64\u5c9b\u5371\u673a\u300b\u7cfb\u5217\u3001\u300a\u6cf0\u5766\u9668\u843d\u300b\u7cfb\u5217\u7b49", "model_answer": "\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u6b3e\u79d1\u5e7b\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5c04\u51fb\u6e38\u620f\uff1a\n1. \u300a\u547d\u8fd02\u300b\n2. \u300a\u5149\u73af\uff1a\u65e0\u9650\u300b\n3. \u300a\u6cf0\u5766\u9668\u843d2\u300b\n4. \u300a\u8d28\u91cf\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u4ed9\u5973\u5ea7\u300b\n5. \u300a\u6bc1\u706d\u6218\u58eb\uff1a\u6c38\u6052\u300b", "row-id": 3735.0, "topic": "entertainment"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The prompt does not provide enough information to determine if the Bookmobile and Portable Library have the same number of books available.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that utilizes text data and audio signals simultaneously to obtain a better understanding of speech data. As emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, our model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and then combines the information from these sources to predict the emotion class. This architecture analyzes speech data from the signal level to the language level, and it thus utilizes the information within the data more comprehensively than models that focus on audio features. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in assigning data to one of four emotion categories (i.e., angry, happy, sad and neutral) when the model is applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, as reflected by accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8%.\n\nHow do they combine audio and text sequences in their RNN?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper describes a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that combines audio and text sequences using dual recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Recently, it has been shown that these embeddings can be effectively learned by aligning two disjoint monolingual vector spaces through linear transformations, using no more than a small bilingual dictionary as supervision. In this work, we propose to apply an additional transformation after the initial alignment step, which moves cross-lingual synonyms towards a middle point between them. By applying this transformation our aim is to obtain a better cross-lingual integration of the vector spaces. In addition, and perhaps surprisingly, the monolingual spaces also improve by this transformation. This is in contrast to the original alignment, which is typically learned such that the structure of the monolingual spaces is preserved. Our experiments confirm that the resulting cross-lingual embeddings outperform state-of-the-art models in both monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation tasks.\n\nWhat are the tasks that this method has shown improvements?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The method has shown improvements in both monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation tasks.", "row-id": 3898.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 1.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To make a coffee that is more delicious than you are used to, you can try using freshly ground high-quality beans, adjusting the grind size, experimenting with different brewing methods, using filtered water, and ensuring the correct water temperature and brewing time.", "tag": "physical_reasoning", "source": "ybisk/piqa", "meta_info": null, "prompt": "To make a coffee that is more delicious than you are used to, you can", "default_answer": "Make it with milk instead of water to give it a creamier taste", "model_answer": "To make a coffee that is more delicious than you are used to, you can try using freshly ground high-quality beans, adjusting the grind size, experimenting with different brewing methods, using filtered water, and ensuring the correct water temperature and brewing time.", "row-id": 3905.0, "topic": "cooking"}, {"specificity": 5.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 4.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 4.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 5.0, "answer": "['a', 'e', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'm', 'p', 'q', 's', 't', 'w', 'x', 'y']", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/flan_v2_converted_1392", "original_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/flan_v2_converted", "question_length": 423}, "prompt": "In this task, you are given an input list A comprising of numbers and alphabets.

We investigate the role of shallow syntax-aware representations for NLP tasks using two techniques. First, we enhance the ELMo architecture to allow pretraining on predicted shallow syntactic parses, instead of just raw text, so that contextual embeddings make use of shallow syntactic context. Our second method involves shallow syntactic features obtained automatically on downstream task data. Neither approach leads to a significant gain on any of the four downstream tasks we considered relative to ELMo-only baselines. Further analysis using black-box probes confirms that our shallow-syntax-aware contextual embeddings do not transfer to linguistic tasks any more easily than ELMo's embeddings. We take these findings as evidence that ELMo-style pretraining discovers representations which make additional awareness of shallow syntax redundant.\n\nDoes this method help in sentiment classification task improvement?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "No, the method does not help in sentiment classification task improvement.

However, most KGs are far from complete and are growing at a rapid pace. To address these problems, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) has been proposed to improve KGs by filling in its missing connections. Unlike existing methods which hold a closed-world assumption, i.e., where KGs are fixed and new entities cannot be easily added, in the present work we relax this assumption and propose a new open-world KGC task. As a first attempt to solve this task we introduce an open-world KGC model called ConMask. This model learns embeddings of the entity's name and parts of its text-description to connect unseen entities to the KG. To mitigate the presence of noisy text descriptions, ConMask uses a relationship-dependent content masking to extract relevant snippets and then trains a fully convolutional neural network to fuse the extracted snippets with entities in the KG.

The conventional encoder-decoder NMT proposed by Cho2014 uses two recurrent neural networks (RNN): one is an encoder, which encodes a source sequence into a fixed-length vector, and the other is a decoder, which decodes the vector into a target sequence. A newly proposed attention-based NMT by DzmitryBahdana2014 can predict output words using the weights of each hidden state of the encoder by the attention mechanism, improving the adequacy of translation.\nEven with the success of attention-based models, a number of open questions remain in NMT. Tu2016 argued two of the common problems are over-translation: some words are repeatedly translated unnecessary and under-translation: some words are mistakenly untranslated. This is due to the fact that NMT can not completely convert the information from the source sentence to the target sentence. Mi2016a and Feng2016 pointed out that NMT lacks the notion of coverage vector in phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT), so unless otherwise specified, there is no way to prevent missing translations.\nAnother problem in NMT is an objective function. NMT is optimized by cross-entropy; therefore, it does not directly maximize the translation accuracy. Shen2016 pointed out that optimization by cross-entropy is not appropriate and proposed a method of optimization based on a translation accuracy score, such as expected BLEU, which led to improvement of translation accuracy. However, BLEU is an evaluation metric based on n-gram precision; therefore, repetition of some words may be present in the translation even though the BLEU score is improved.\nTo address to problem of repeating and missing words in the translation, tu2016neural introduce an encoder-decoder-reconstructor framework that optimizes NMT by back-translation from the output sentences into the original source sentences. In their method, after training the forward translation in a manner similar to the conventional attention-based NMT, they train a back-translation model from the hidden state of the decoder into the source sequence by a new decoder to enforce agreement between source and target sentences.\nIn order to confirm the language independence of the framework, we experiment on two parallel corpora of English-Japanese and Japanese-English translation tasks using encode-decoder-reconstructor. Our experiments show that their method offers significant improvement in BLEU scores and alleviates the problem of repeating and missing words in the translation on English-Japanese translation task, though the difference is not significant on Japanese-English translation task.\nIn addition, we jointly train a model of forward translation and back-translation without pre-training, and then evaluate this model. As a result, the encoder-decoder-reconstructor can not be trained well without pre-training, so it proves that we have to train the forward translation model in a manner similar to the conventional attention-based NMT as pre-training.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\nRelated Works\nSeveral studies have addressed the NMT-specific problem of missing or repeating words. Niehues2016 optimized NMT by adding the outputs of PBSMT to the input of NMT. Mi2016a and Feng2016 introduced a distributed version of coverage vector taken from PBSMT to consider which words have been already translated. All these methods, including ours, employ information of the source sentence to improve the quality of translation, but our method uses back-translation to ensure that there is no inconsistency. Unlike other methods, once learned, our method is identical to the conventional NMT model, so it does not need any additional parameters such as coverage vector or a PBSMT system for testing.\nThe attention mechanism proposed by Meng2016 considers not only \nQuestion: Is pre-training effective in their evaluation?", "default_answer": "Yes", "model_answer": "Yes, pre-training is effective in their evaluation.

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +13.8% average accuracy on XNLI, +12.3% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.1% average F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 11.8% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 9.2% for Urdu over the previous XLM model.

These speeches provide invaluable information on state preferences on a wide range of issues, including international development, but have largely been overlooked in the study of global politics.

The architecture is a hierarchy of self-attention mechanisms and BiLSTM encoders followed by CRF tagging layers. We describe a variety of experiments, showing that our approach obtains promising results on a dataset annotated with Dialogue Acts and Frame Semantics. Moreover, we demonstrate its applicability to a different, publicly available NLU dataset annotated with domain-specific intents and corresponding semantic roles, providing overall performance higher than state-of-the-art tools such as RASA, Dialogflow, LUIS, and Watson.

This task is thought to play an important role in natural language understanding, speech production, and the development of speech recognition systems. The concept of the syllable is cross-linguistic, though formal definitions are rarely agreed upon, even within a language. In response, data-driven syllabification methods have been developed to learn from syllabified examples. These methods often employ classical machine learning sequence labeling models. In recent years, recurrence-based neural networks have been shown to perform increasingly well for sequence labeling tasks such as named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging, and chunking. We present a novel approach to the syllabification problem which leverages modern neural network techniques. Our network is constructed with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, a convolutional component, and a conditional random field (CRF) output layer. Existing syllabification approaches are rarely evaluated across multiple language families. To demonstrate cross-linguistic generalizability, we show that the network is competitive with state of the art systems in syllabifying English, Dutch, Italian, French, Manipuri, and Basque datasets.\n\nWhat are the datasets used for the task?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The datasets used for the task are English, Dutch, Italian, French, Manipuri, and Basque.", "row-id": 4160.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "As of now, Virat Kohli is often considered a star player of the India National Cricket Team.

Our solution is to use an intermediate English poem description of the painting and then apply language style transfer which results in Shakespearean prose describing the painting. We rate our results by human evaluation on a Likert scale, and evaluate the quality of language style transfer using BLEU score as a function of prose length.

Despite this success, recent work by Schick and Schutze (2019) suggests that these architectures struggle to understand rare words. For context-independent word embeddings, this problem can be addressed by separately learning representations for infrequent words. In this work, we show that the same idea can also be applied to contextualized models and clearly improves their downstream task performance. Most approaches for inducing word embeddings into existing embedding spaces are based on simple bag-of-words models; hence they are not a suitable counterpart for deep neural network language models. To overcome this problem, we introduce BERTRAM, a powerful architecture based on a pretrained BERT language model and capable of inferring high-quality representations for rare words. In BERTRAM, surface form and contexts of a word directly interact with each other in a deep architecture. Both on a rare word probing task and on three downstream task datasets, BERTRAM considerably improves representations for rare and medium frequency words compared to both a standalone BERT model and previous work.\n\nWhat models other than standalone BERT is new model compared to?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify the exact models other than standalone BERT that BERTRAM is compared to, but it mentions previous work and models based on simple bag-of-words approaches.", "row-id": 4249.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To make a dish with rutabaga and wheatberries, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1.

The Transformer architecture on which BERT is based places hierarchical global attention on the concatenation of the context and query. Our additions to the BERT architecture augment this attention with a more focused context to query (C2Q) and query to context (Q2C) attention via a set of modified Transformer encoder units. In addition, we explore adding convolution-based feature extraction within the coattention architecture to add localized information to self-attention. We found that coattention significantly improves the no answer F1 by 4 points in the base and 1 point in the large architecture. After adding skip connections the no answer F1 improved further without causing an additional loss in has answer F1. The addition of localized feature extraction added to attention produced an overall dev F1 of 77.03 in the base architecture. We applied our findings to the large BERT model which contains twice as many layers and further used our own augmented version of the SQUAD 2.0 dataset created by back translation, which we have named SQUAD 2.Q. Finally, we performed hyperparameter tuning and ensembled our best models for a final F1/EM of 82.317/79.442 (Attention on Steroids, PCE Test Leaderboard).\n\nHow much F1 was improved after adding skip connections?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The F1 score for 'no answer' improved further after adding skip connections, but the exact amount of improvement is not specified in the abstract.", "row-id": 4323.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To clean Legos in a washing machine, place them in a mesh laundry bag to prevent them from scattering.

For the 2017 Multi-Genre Broadcast challenge (MGB-3) there were two possible tasks: Arabic speech recognition, and Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In this paper, we describe our efforts to create an ADI system for the MGB-3 challenge, with the goal of distinguishing amongst four major Arabic dialects, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Our research fo- cused on dialect variability and domain mismatches between the training and test domain. In order to achieve a robust ADI system, we explored both Siamese neural network models to learn similarity and dissimilarities among Arabic dialects, as well as i-vector post-processing to adapt domain mismatches. Both Acoustic and linguistic features were used for the final MGB-3 submissions, with the best primary system achieving 75% accuracy on the official 10hr test set.\n\nHow do they explore domain mismatch?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "They explore domain mismatch by using i-vector post-processing to adapt to domain mismatches between the training and test domain.", "row-id": 4396.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 3.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To put drainage holes in a planter, you can use a drill with a suitable drill bit for the material of the planter (e.g., masonry bit for ceramic, wood bit for wooden planters).

As of the 2020 census, the county population was 30,223. The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.\n\nIn 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican\u2013American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n19th century\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County.\n\nPeketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas.\n\nIn 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace\u2014the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years.\n\nIn April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since.\n\nAs early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company.  In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

We propose two novel unsupervised approaches to generate acoustic embeddings by modelling of acoustic context. The first approach is a contextual joint factor synthesis encoder, where the encoder in an encoder/decoder framework is trained to extract joint factors from surrounding audio frames to best generate the target output. The second approach is a contextual joint factor analysis encoder, where the encoder is trained to analyse joint factors from the source signal that correlates best with the neighbouring audio. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches compared to prior work, we chose two tasks - phone classification and speaker recognition - and test on different TIMIT data sets. Experimental results show that one of our proposed approaches outperforms phone classification baselines, yielding a classification accuracy of 74.1%. When using additional out-of-domain data for training, an additional 2-3% improvements can be obtained, for both for phone classification and speaker recognition tasks.\n\nWhich approach out of two proposed in the paper performed better in experiments?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify which of the two proposed approaches performed better in the experiments.", "row-id": 4412.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To clean your tennis shoes, first remove the laces and insoles.

They capture semantic and syntactic relations among words but the vector corresponding to the words are only meaningful relative to each other. Neither the vector nor its dimensions have any absolute, interpretable meaning. We introduce an additive modification to the objective function of the embedding learning algorithm that encourages the embedding vectors of words that are semantically related to a predefined concept to take larger values along a specified dimension, while leaving the original semantic learning mechanism mostly unaffected. In other words, we align words that are already determined to be related, along predefined concepts. Therefore, we impart interpretability to the word embedding by assigning meaning to its vector dimensions. The predefined concepts are derived from an external lexical resource, which in this paper is chosen as Roget's Thesaurus. We observe that alignment along the chosen concepts is not limited to words in the Thesaurus and extends to other related words as well. We quantify the extent of interpretability and assignment of meaning from our experimental results.

Most previous methods require that all entities should be seen during training, which is unpractical for real-world knowledge graphs with new entities emerging on a daily basis. Recent efforts on this issue suggest training a neighborhood aggregator in conjunction with the conventional entity and relation embeddings, which may help embed new entities inductively via their existing neighbors. However, their neighborhood aggregators neglect the unordered and unequal natures of an entity's neighbors. To this end, we summarize the desired properties that may lead to effective neighborhood aggregators. We also introduce a novel aggregator, namely, Logic Attention Network (LAN), which addresses the properties by aggregating neighbors with both rules- and network-based attention weights. By comparing with conventional aggregators on two knowledge graph completion tasks, we experimentally validate LAN's superiority in terms of the desired properties.\n\nDo they evaluate existing methods in terms of desired properties?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Yes, they evaluate existing methods in terms of the desired properties by comparing the Logic Attention Network (LAN) with conventional aggregators on two knowledge graph completion tasks.", "row-id": 4451.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "The average height for a male varies by region and population, but globally it is approximately 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).

Additionally, there is evidence that humans process an utterance by separating knowledge about the lexicon from syntax knowledge. Theories from semantics and neuroscience claim that complete word meanings are not encoded in the representation of syntax. In this paper, we propose neural units that can enforce this constraint over an LSTM encoder and decoder. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance across a variety of domains including semantic parsing, syntactic parsing, and English to Mandarin Chinese translation. In these cases, our model outperforms the standard LSTM encoder and decoder architecture on many or all of our metrics. To demonstrate that our model achieves the desired separation between the lexicon and syntax, we analyze its weights and explore its behavior when different neural modules are damaged. When damaged, we find that the model displays the knowledge distortions that aphasics are evidenced to have.\n\nDo they perform a quantitative analysis of their model displaying knowledge distortions?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract suggests that they analyze the model's weights and explore its behavior when different neural modules are damaged, which implies a form of quantitative analysis of knowledge distortions.

Understanding the semantic representation of tweets can benefit a plethora of applications such as sentiment analysis BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , hashtag prediction BIBREF2 , paraphrase detection BIBREF3 and microblog ranking BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 . However, tweets are difficult to model as they pose several challenges such as short length, informal words, unusual grammar and misspellings. Recently, researchers are focusing on leveraging unsupervised representation learning methods based on neural networks to solve this problem. Once these representations are learned, we can use off-the-shelf predictors taking the representation as input to solve the downstream task BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . These methods enjoy several advantages: (1) they are cheaper to train, as they work with unlabelled data, (2) they reduce the dependence on domain level experts, and (3) they are highly effective across multiple applications, in practice.\nDespite this, there is a lack of prior work which surveys the tweet-specific unsupervised representation learning models. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap by investigating the models in an organized fashion. Specifically, we group the models based on the objective function it optimizes. We believe this work can aid the understanding of the existing literature. We conclude the paper by presenting interesting future research directions, which we believe are fruitful in advancing this field by building high-quality tweet representation learning models.\nUnsupervised Tweet Representation Models\nThere are various models spanning across different model architectures and objective functions in the literature to compute tweet representation in an unsupervised fashion. These models work in a semi-supervised way - the representations generated by the model is fed to an off-the-shelf predictor like Support Vector Machines (SVM) to solve a particular downstream task. These models span across a wide variety of neural network based architectures including average of word vectors, convolutional-based, recurrent-based and so on. We believe that the performance of these models is highly dependent on the objective function it optimizes \u2013 predicting adjacent word (within-tweet relationships), adjacent tweet (inter-tweet relationships), the tweet itself (autoencoder), modeling from structured resources like paraphrase databases and weak supervision. In this section, we provide the first of its kind survey of the recent tweet-specific unsupervised models in an organized fashion to understand the literature. Specifically, we categorize each model based on the optimized objective function as shown in Figure FIGREF1 . Next, we study each category one by one.\nModeling within-tweet relationships\nMotivation: Every tweet is assumed to have a latent topic vector, which influences the distribution of the words in the tweet. For example, though the appearance of the phrase catch the ball is frequent in the corpus, if we know that the topic of a tweet is about \u201ctechnology\u201d, we can expect words such as bug or exception after the word catch (ignoring the) instead of the word ball since catch the bug/exception is more plausible under the topic \u201ctechnology\u201d. On the other hand, if the topic of the tweet is about \u201csports\u201d, then we can expect ball after catch. These intuitions indicate that the prediction of neighboring words for a given word strongly relies on the tweet also.\nModels: BIBREF8 's work is the first to exploit this idea to compute distributed document representations that are good at predicting words in the document. They propose two models: PV-DM and PV-DBOW, that are extensions of Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram model variants of the popular Word2Vec model BIBREF9 respectively \u2013 PV-DM inserts an additional document token (wh\nQuestion: Do they evaluate their learned representations on downstream tasks?", "default_answer": "No", "model_answer": "Yes, the context mentions that the representations generated by the models are fed to off-the-shelf predictors like Support Vector Machines (SVM) to solve particular downstream tasks.", "row-id": 4645.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 5.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 4.0, "answer": "Yes, the abstract indicates that AraNet was trained to predict age, dialect, gender, emotion, irony, and sentiment, suggesting they experimented on all these tasks.", "tag": "context_based", "source": "allenai/qasper", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "1912.13072"}, "prompt": "You are given a paper:\nTitle: AraNet: A Deep Learning Toolkit for Arabic Social Media\nAbstract: We describe AraNet, a collection of deep learning Arabic social media processing tools.

We propose a multi-style abstractive summarization model for question answering, called Masque. The proposed model has two key characteristics. First, unlike most studies on RC that have focused on extracting an answer span from the provided passages, our model instead focuses on generating a summary from the question and multiple passages. This serves to cover various answer styles required for real-world applications. Second, whereas previous studies built a specific model for each answer style because of the difficulty of acquiring one general model, our approach learns multi-style answers within a model to improve the NLG capability for all styles involved. This also enables our model to give an answer in the target style. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Q&A task and the Q&A + NLG task of MS MARCO 2.1 and the summary task of NarrativeQA. We observe that the transfer of the style-independent NLG capability to the target style is the key to its success.\n\nWhat do they mean by answer styles?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "In the context of the paper, 'answer styles' refer to the different ways in which answers can be generated or presented in response to questions.

Specifically, our approach is based on the divergence between the conditional probability distributions over entity pairs. In this paper, these distributions are parameterized by a very simple neural network. Although computing the exact similarity is in-tractable, we provide a sampling-based method to get a good approximation. We empirically show the outputs of our approach significantly correlate with human judgments. By applying our method to various tasks, we also find that (1) our approach could effectively detect redundant relations extracted by open information extraction (Open IE) models, that (2) even the most competitive models for relational classification still make mistakes among very similar relations, and that (3) our approach could be incorporated into negative sampling and softmax classification to alleviate these mistakes.

Free text constitutes a large portion of such data, yet this source of richly detailed information often remains under-used in practice because of a lack of suitable methodologies to extract interpretable content in a timely manner. Here we apply network-theoretical tools to the analysis of free text in Hospital Patient Incident reports in the English National Health Service, to find clusters of reports in an unsupervised manner and at different levels of resolution based directly on the free text descriptions contained within them. To do so, we combine recently developed deep neural network text-embedding methodologies based on paragraph vectors with multi-scale Markov Stability community detection applied to a similarity graph of documents obtained from sparsified text vector similarities. We showcase the approach with the analysis of incident reports submitted in Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London. The multiscale community structure reveals levels of meaning with different resolution in the topics of the dataset, as shown by relevant descriptive terms extracted from the groups of records, as well as by comparing a posteriori against hand-coded categories assigned by healthcare personnel. Our content communities exhibit good correspondence with well-defined hand-coded categories, yet our results also provide further medical detail in certain areas as well as revealing complementary descriptors of incidents beyond the external classification. We also discuss how the method can be used to monitor reports over time and across different healthcare providers, and to detect emerging trends that fall outside of pre-existing categories.\n\nWhich text embedding methodologies are used?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The text embedding methodologies used are based on paragraph vectors.", "row-id": 4768.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To attach the wood together for the box, you can use nails, screws, or wood glue.

In prior work, [Crannell et. al.], we have studied an active cancer patient population on Twitter and compiled a set of tweets describing their experience with this disease. We refer to these online public testimonies as\"Invisible Patient Reported Outcomes\"(iPROs), because they carry relevant indicators, yet are difficult to capture by conventional means of self-report. Methods: Our present study aims to identify tweets related to the patient experience as an additional informative tool for monitoring public health. Using Twitter's public streaming API, we compiled over 5.3 million\"breast cancer\"related tweets spanning September 2016 until mid December 2017. We combined supervised machine learning methods with natural language processing to sift tweets relevant to breast cancer patient experiences. We analyzed a sample of 845 breast cancer patient and survivor accounts, responsible for over 48,000 posts. We investigated tweet content with a hedonometric sentiment analysis to quantitatively extract emotionally charged topics. Results: We found that positive experiences were shared regarding patient treatment, raising support, and spreading awareness. Further discussions related to healthcare were prevalent and largely negative focusing on fear of political legislation that could result in loss of coverage. Conclusions: Social media can provide a positive outlet for patients to discuss their needs and concerns regarding their healthcare coverage and treatment needs. Capturing iPROs from online communication can help inform healthcare professionals and lead to more connected and personalized treatment regimens.\n\nHow were breast cancer related posts compiled from the Twitter streaming API?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Breast cancer related posts were compiled from the Twitter streaming API by using keywords related to 'breast cancer' to collect tweets spanning September 2016 until mid December 2017.", "row-id": 4799.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "No, the cooking methods for Paella and Churros are not similar.

Current neural encoder-decoder models conflate both steps into a black-box architecture. As a result, the content to be described in the text cannot be explicitly controlled. This paper tackles this problem by decoupling content selection from the decoder. The decoupled content selection is human interpretable, whose value can be manually manipulated to control the content of generated text. The model can be trained end-to-end without human annotations by maximizing a lower bound of the marginal likelihood. We further propose an effective way to trade-off between performance and controllability with a single adjustable hyperparameter.

In this paper we extend that capability by proposing a new task: assessing whether or not a joke is humorous. We present a novel way of approaching this problem by building a model that learns to identify humorous jokes based on ratings gleaned from Reddit pages, consisting of almost 16,000 labeled instances. Using these ratings to determine the level of humor, we then employ a Transformer architecture for its advantages in learning from sentence context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show results that are comparable to human performance. We further demonstrate our model's increased capabilities on humor identification problems, such as the previously created datasets for short jokes and puns. These experiments show that this method outperforms all previous work done on these tasks, with an F-measure of 93.1% for the Puns dataset and 98.6% on the Short Jokes dataset.\n\nWhat kind of humor they have evaluated?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The paper evaluates humor in the form of jokes, specifically focusing on short jokes and puns.", "row-id": 4898.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 4.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 3.0, "problem_solving": 4.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 4.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 5.0, "answer": "Step-by-step reasoning process: Scruffy weighs 12 ounces.

The store also offers an installation service. For $50.00 they will come to your house and professionally hang your curtains and prints. If Emily agrees to this service, how much will her entire order cost?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: She buys 2 pair of curtains for $30.00 each so that's 2 * 30 = $60.00. She buys 9 wall prints at $15.00 each so that's 9 * 15 = $135.00. The curtains cost $60.00, the prints are $135.00 and the installation service is $50.00 for a total of 60 + 135 + 50 = $245.00.\nThe answer is 245.\n\nAnswer the following question.\nA church has 100 members who've volunteered to bake cookies for the homeless in their local town. If each member baked 10 sheets of cookies, and each sheet has 16 cookies, calculate the total number of cookies the church members baked?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: A sheet has 16 cookies, so if each church member baked 10 sheets, they each baked 10 sheets / person * 16 cookies / sheet = 160 cookies / person. The total number of church members who decided to volunteer is 100, so in total, they baked 160 cookies / person * 100 people = 16000 cookies.\nThe answer is 16000.\n\nAnswer the following question.\nJuvy has a garden that has 20 rows with 10 plants in each row. She plants parsley in the first 3 rows and rosemary in the last two rows. The rest of the rows will be planted with chives.

In its simplest form, it is performed on a polarity basis, where the goal is to classify information with positive or negative emotion. Recent research has explored more nuanced ways to capture emotions that go beyond polarity. For these methods to work, they require a critical resource: a lexicon that is appropriate for the task at hand, in terms of the range of emotions it captures diversity. In the past, sentiment analysis lexicons have been created by experts, such as linguists and behavioural scientists, with strict rules. Lexicon evaluation was also performed by experts or gold standards.

For the purpose of training a hate speech detection system, the reliability of the annotations is crucial, but there is no universally agreed-upon definition. We collected potentially hateful messages and asked two groups of internet users to determine whether they were hate speech or not, whether they should be banned or not and to rate their degree of offensiveness. One of the groups was shown a definition prior to completing the survey. We aimed to assess whether hate speech can be annotated reliably, and the extent to which existing definitions are in accordance with subjective ratings. Our results indicate that showing users a definition caused them to partially align their own opinion with the definition but did not improve reliability, which was very low overall. We conclude that the presence of hate speech should perhaps not be considered a binary yes-or-no decision, and raters need more detailed instructions for the annotation.\n\nHow did the authors demonstrate that showing a hate speech definition caused annotators to partially align their own opinion with the definition?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The authors demonstrated that showing a hate speech definition caused annotators to partially align their own opinion with the definition by comparing the annotations from the group that was shown the definition with the group that was not.

Managing, exploring, and utilizing such large and complicated datasets effectively are challenging. In recent years, the knowledge graph has emerged as a universal data format for representing knowledge about heterogeneous entities and their relationships. The knowledge graph can be modeled by knowledge graph embedding methods, which represent entities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space, then model the interactions between these embedding vectors. However, the semantic structures in the knowledge graph embedding space are not well-studied, thus knowledge graph embedding methods are usually only used for knowledge graph completion but not data representation and analysis. In this paper, we propose to analyze these semantic structures based on the well-studied word embedding space and use them to support data exploration. We also define the semantic queries, which are algebraic operations between the embedding vectors in the knowledge graph embedding space, to solve queries such as similarity and analogy between the entities on the original datasets. We then design a general framework for data exploration by semantic queries and discuss the solution to some traditional scholarly data exploration tasks. We also propose some new interesting tasks that can be solved based on the uncanny semantic structures of the embedding space.\n\nWhat new interesting tasks can be solved based on the uncanny semantic structures of the embedding space?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract does not specify the new interesting tasks that can be solved based on the uncanny semantic structures of the embedding space.

Recently, Caglayan et al. posit that the observed gains are limited mainly due to the very simple, short, repetitive sentences of the Multi30k dataset (the only multimodal MT dataset available at the time), which renders the source text sufficient for context. In this work, we further investigate this hypothesis on a new large scale multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) dataset, How2, which has 1.57 times longer mean sentence length than Multi30k and no repetition. We propose and evaluate three novel fusion techniques, each of which is designed to ensure the utilization of visual context at different stages of the Sequence-to-Sequence transduction pipeline, even under full linguistic context. However, we still obtain only marginal gains under full linguistic context and posit that visual embeddings extracted from deep vision models (ResNet for Multi30k, ResNext for How2) do not lend themselves to increasing the discriminativeness between the vocabulary elements at token level prediction in NMT. We demonstrate this qualitatively by analyzing attention distribution and quantitatively through Principal Component Analysis, arriving at the conclusion that it is the quality of the visual embeddings rather than the length of sentences, which need to be improved in existing MMT datasets.\n\nWhat is result of their Principal Component Analysis?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The result of their Principal Component Analysis suggests that the quality of the visual embeddings needs to be improved in existing MMT datasets, as it does not significantly increase the discriminativeness between vocabulary elements at the token level prediction in NMT.", "row-id": 4960.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 3.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "En 2018, un Tesla Model S con todas las prestaciones pod\u00eda costar aproximadamente entre $100,000 y $140,000 d\u00f3lares, dependiendo de las opciones y caracter\u00edsticas adicionales seleccionadas.", "tag": "knowledge_based", "source": "allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "oasst1_194", "original_dataset": "ai2-adapt-dev/oasst1_converted", "question_length": 92}, "prompt": "\u00bfCu\u00e1nto costaba (aproximadamente, en d\u00f3lares) un tesla, con todas las prestaciones, en 2018?", "default_answer": "Un Tesla promedio en 2018 lleg\u00f3 a valer un m\u00ednimo de $35.000 (d\u00f3lares).", "model_answer": "En 2018, un Tesla Model S con todas las prestaciones pod\u00eda costar aproximadamente entre $100,000 y $140,000 d\u00f3lares, dependiendo de las opciones y caracter\u00edsticas adicionales seleccionadas.", "row-id": 4962.0, "topic": "economy"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 4.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "As of 2023, Kylie Jenner's net worth is estimated to be around $700 million.

The former models enjoy high inference efficiency with linear time complexity, but they rely on the stacking or re-ranking of partially-built parse trees to build a complete parse tree and are stuck with slower training for the necessity of dynamic oracle training. The latter, graph-based models, may boast better performance but are unfortunately marred by polynomial time inference. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing order objective, resulting in a novel dependency parsing model capable of both global (in sentence scope) feature extraction as in graph models and linear time inference as in transitional models. The proposed global greedy parser only uses two arc-building actions, left and right arcs, for projective parsing. When equipped with two extra non-projective arc-building actions, the proposed parser may also smoothly support non-projective parsing. Using multiple benchmark treebanks, including the Penn Treebank (PTB), the CoNLL-X treebanks, and the Universal Dependency Treebanks, we evaluate our parser and demonstrate that the proposed novel parser achieves good performance with faster training and decoding.\n\nWhat are performance compared to former models?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The abstract indicates that the proposed global greedy parser achieves good performance with faster training and decoding compared to former models, but specific performance metrics or comparisons are not provided in the abstract.", "row-id": 4970.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 3.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 1.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "Protein is used by the human body to build and repair tissues, make enzymes and hormones, and is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.", "tag": "multiple_choice", "source": "allenai/ai2_arc", "meta_info": {"id_in_dataset": "Mercury_SC_LBS10477"}, "prompt": "Protein is used by the human body to", "default_answer": "repair cells.", "model_answer": "Protein is used by the human body to build and repair tissues, make enzymes and hormones, and is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.", "row-id": 4972.0, "topic": "biology"}, {"specificity": 2.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 3.0, "creativity": 3.0, "technical_accuracy": 2.0, "real_world": 4.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To ensure a hairpiece is not visible, match the color and texture to your natural hair, position it correctly, use clips or pins to secure it, and style your hair to blend the hairpiece seamlessly.

I decided that I didn't want to play with the cup all day long just to go pee. I don't know, maybe the softer silicone cup would work out better. From a toxic perspective, I'm not sure how I feel about putting silicone in my body. I was more comfortable with using natural rubber.

They also wear better than cheaper products: I had my last pair for nearly ten years before the silicon began to wear out. I would recommend them to anyone like myself who has a small bust and lacks confidence because of this: they give my figure a more balanced look and make me feel terriffic! They can be worn in any underwired bra, bikini or swimsuit Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?", "default_answer": "flattering", "model_answer": "flattering", "row-id": 5093.0, "topic": "entertainment"}, {"specificity": 3.0, "domain_knowledge": 2.0, "complexity": 2.0, "problem_solving": 2.0, "creativity": 4.0, "technical_accuracy": 1.0, "real_world": 3.0, "context_complete": 3.0, "answer": "Talkback needs improvement.

In an information-centric view, translated texts may be considered as semantic mirrors of the original text and the significant variations that we can observe across various languages can be used to disambiguate a given expression using the linguistic signal that is grounded in translation. Parallel corpora consisting of massive amounts of human translations with a large linguistic variation can be applied to increase abstractions and we propose the use of highly multilingual machine translation models to find language-independent meaning representations. Our initial experiments show that neural machine translation models can indeed learn in such a setup and we can show that the learning algorithm picks up information about the relation between languages in order to optimize transfer leaning with shared parameters. The model creates a continuous language space that represents relationships in terms of geometric distances, which we can visualize to illustrate how languages cluster according to language families and groups. Does this open the door for new ideas of data-driven language typology with promising models and techniques in empirical cross-linguistic research?\n\nWhat neural machine translation models can learn in terms of transfer learning?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "Neural machine translation models can learn language-independent meaning representations and the relationships between languages, optimizing transfer learning with shared parameters.

Most existing methodologies use text similarity metrics to identify whether two articles are related or not. However biomedical knowledge discovery is hypothesis-driven. The most related articles may not be ones with the highest text similarities. In this study, we first develop an innovative crowd-sourcing approach to build an expert-annotated document-ranking corpus. Using this corpus as the gold standard, we then evaluate the approaches of using text similarity to rank the relatedness of articles. Finally, we develop and evaluate a new supervised model to automatically rank related scientific articles. Our results show that authors' ranking differ significantly from rankings by text-similarity-based models. By training a learning-to-rank model on a subset of the annotated corpus, we found the best supervised learning-to-rank model (SVM-Rank) significantly surpassed state-of-the-art baseline systems.\n\nwhat is the supervised model they developed?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The supervised model they developed is a learning-to-rank model using SVM-Rank.", "row-id": 5116.0, "topic": "research"}, {"specificity": 1.0, "domain_knowledge": 1.0, "complexity": 1.0, "problem_solving": 1.0, "creativity": 2.0, "technical_accuracy": 1.0, "real_world": 5.0, "context_complete": 1.0, "answer": "To make avocado toast, you will need bread, an avocado, salt, and pepper.

One prominent case of an event leading to circulation of disinformation on social media is the MH17 plane crash. Studies analysing the spread of information about this event on Twitter have focused on small, manually annotated datasets, or used proxys for data annotation. In this work, we examine to what extent text classifiers can be used to label data for subsequent content analysis, in particular we focus on predicting pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian Twitter content related to the MH17 plane crash. Even though we find that a neural classifier improves over a hashtag based baseline, labeling pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian content with high precision remains a challenging problem. We provide an error analysis underlining the difficulty of the task and identify factors that might help improve classification in future work. Finally, we show how the classifier can facilitate the annotation task for human annotators.\n\nHow can the classifier facilitate the annotation task for human annotators?", "default_answer": null, "model_answer": "The classifier can facilitate the annotation task for human annotators by pre-labeling the data, thus reducing the amount of manual work required.

In this paper, we propose Cross-Lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (CLMRC) task for the languages other than English. Firstly, we present several back-translation approaches for CLMRC task, which is straightforward to adopt. However, to accurately align the answer into another language is difficult and could introduce additional noise. In this context, we propose a novel model called Dual BERT, which takes advantage of the large-scale training data provided by rich-resource language (such as English) and learn the semantic relations between the passage and question in a bilingual context, and then utilize the learned knowledge to improve reading comprehension performance of low-resource language. We conduct experiments on two Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets CMRC 2018 and DRCD. The results show consistent and significant improvements over various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin, which demonstrate the potentials in CLMRC task.
